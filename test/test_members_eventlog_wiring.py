"""End-to-end wiring of the per-member append-only event log into the members
surfaces: the roster projections + lazy config reconcile, the startup
reconcile sweep, the record/read round trip, and the agent
PUT config-change hook.

Isolation: every test re-roots the members space at a fresh ``tmp_path`` by
monkeypatching ``kiro_crew.members.data_home`` (``get_service()`` rebuilds its
singleton when ``members_root()`` moves) and drops the cached service with
``set_service(None)`` via the ``_fresh_eventlog`` fixture, so no test observes
another test's log. The fixture pattern for the aiohttp routes mirrors the
neighbouring ``test_members_dm_thread.py``.
