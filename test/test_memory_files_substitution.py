"""The seam DECIDES which storage answers -- not whichever directory exists on disk.

The point of ``MemoryFiles`` is that memory's storage becomes a choice. A test
suite that only ever runs the local implementation cannot tell that apart from
the old behaviour, because on a developer's machine the local tree exists and
answers correctly either way. So these tests compose a context whose provider
returns a NON-local implementation and assert the two halves of substitution:

* the injected implementation is what answers, even when a local tree exists and
  holds different bytes -- so a mounted read cannot be silently served from a
  stale local copy; and
* removing the local tree entirely does not affect the answer -- so the mounted
  read genuinely does not depend on local disk.

Those are the two directions the internal edition's Drive mount has to satisfy,
expressed here against an in-memory stand-in so they are pinned in the PUBLIC
repository, where the seam lives. The Drive-backed half of the same pair lives
with the mount adapter, which is the only place that knows what a Drive is.

The stand-in is deliberately NOT a mock: it stores real text in a dict and
implements the protocol's semantics, so a test that passes here is evidence the
protocol is implementable by something that is not a filesystem -- which is the
claim the seam makes.
