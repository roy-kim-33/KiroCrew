"""Cross-channel contract: ``max_buttons`` is ENFORCED, per channel.

The capability ledger (``test_capability_ledger.py``) says the field is
enforced; THIS file is what makes that claim unforgeable. For every channel
declaring ``max_buttons > 0`` it drives the real options path with an
over-cap list and pins:

1. exactly ``max_buttons`` choices render interactively, and
2. the overflow degrades to a numbered text list (numbering continues after
   the widget slots) instead of being silently dropped — the pre-enforcement
   behavior lost choices without any user-visible signal.

A channel declaring ``max_buttons == 0`` renders no widget, and the same helper
answers it with zero widget slots: EVERY choice becomes a numbered line. That
half is pinned here too, because dropping the list deletes the answers to a
question the agent just asked and the user is left with a prompt and no way to
see what it offered.

Two ratchets keep both halves exhaustive: a channel that starts declaring
``max_buttons > 0`` without a pin in this file fails
``test_every_widget_channel_is_pinned_here``, and a zero-widget channel absent
from ``ZERO_WIDGET_RENDERERS`` fails
``test_every_zero_widget_channel_is_pinned_here``. The second is keyed on a
renderer FACTORY rather than a name, because ``text()`` is not on the ``Renderer``
ABC — nothing in code forces a zero-widget renderer to call the helper, so the
ratchet has to demand something it can actually drive.
