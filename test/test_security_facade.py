"""Guards for the ``kiro_crew.security`` facade.

The security controls are split by responsibility across submodules of the
``security`` package while ``kiro_crew.security`` stays the only import path.
Roughly forty modules import from it, the platform layer registers a seam site
on it by dotted name, and tests reach private helpers as attributes of it and
patch them by dotted string. "The split changed nothing for a caller" is
therefore a claim about two properties, and this module is what makes it a
tested claim rather than a remembered one:

* every name in the frozen manifest resolves on the facade, answering with the
  SAME object the submodule that owns it holds; and
* an attribute written on the facade reaches that owning submodule, because code
  inside the submodule resolves the name through its own globals and would
  otherwise keep running the unpatched object -- a patch that passes while
  testing nothing.

The failure both guards exist to catch is silent. A missing re-export surfaces
as an unrelated test's ``AttributeError`` several commits after the move that
dropped it, and an unmirrored patch surfaces as a test that stops exercising
what its name says.

The storage rule behind the first property -- that the value lives in the owner's
namespace and nowhere else, and that the owner is looked up in ``sys.modules``
rather than remembered -- is held in ``test_security_single_storage.py``.
