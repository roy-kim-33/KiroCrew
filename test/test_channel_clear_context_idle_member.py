"""A live channel member must not refuse clear-context for its whole lifetime.

`run_channel_agent` takes the session lease once at spawn and releases it only when the
member dies, so a busy probe that reads the LEASE answers "busy" for as long as the member
exists. The contract this PR ships says a 409 is retryable once the named roles finish, and
the banner tells the user to retry when idle -- so a lease-scoped probe makes that retry
unsatisfiable on any channel with live members, idle ones included.

These drive the REAL `discard_conversation`, not a stub: a stubbed teardown returns whatever
the test says and so cannot observe the predicate at all.
