"""``GET /api/instances/{id}/chat-slots`` — a peer's live sessions, deduplicated.

The merged-sessions sidebar renders a connected peer's OPEN sessions as ordinary
rows in this machine's Sessions list. Reading the peer's ``/api/chat/slots``
straight through a proxy hop is what it did first, and it double-renders one
conversation: a local session bound to that peer for EXECUTION (``executor ==
"remote"``) is backed by a real slot ON the peer, so the peer lists it alongside
its own. The browser then shows the same chat twice — once as the local row the
user can type in, once as a read-only peer row that navigates to the instance
pane — and cannot tell they are the same, because the correlating
``remote_slot`` is deliberately never projected to it.

So the filter lives here, where the binding already does. These tests pin the
filter's edges (which bindings count, which rows survive) and the untrusted-input
discipline every peer read in this module shares: bound before decoding, refuse
rather than reshape.
