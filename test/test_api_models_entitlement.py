"""Tests for the model picker's entitlement narrowing (/api/models, kiro path).

``kiro chat --list-models`` is a CATALOG, not an entitlement: it returns the same
rows whatever the account's plan. So after a downgrade the picker kept offering —
and the composer kept displaying as selected — a premium model no turn could run,
while the session itself quietly ran on the backend default.

The tier-aware signal is the live session's ``session/new`` ``availableModels``
list, the same one ``model_is_unusable`` pre-flights against. These tests pin that
it narrows the catalog when known, and that every unknowable case FAILS OPEN
(returns the full catalog) rather than emptying the picker.

The read path additionally revalidates that snapshot before it narrows: an
unconfirmed startup-race snapshot would silently hide entitled models, and the
picker has no explicit-pick refusal to trigger the refresh-before-refuse heal.
The narrowing assertions below give each fake provider a probe that AGREES with
its snapshot (the common case), so they pin the narrowing itself; the read-path
revalidation is exercised by its own section at the end.
