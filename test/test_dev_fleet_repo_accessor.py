"""``MAIN_REPO`` reaches git and the filesystem only through ``_repo()``.

Dev Fleet represents "no main checkout found" as an empty string in
``MAIN_REPO``. That sentinel is fail-open at any call site that consumes the
global directly: ``git -C ""`` does not fail — it silently runs against the
backend process's working directory — and ``Path("")`` is ``Path(".")``, so an
unguarded consumer operates on an arbitrary directory and returns plausible
results. The ``_repo()`` accessor centralizes the guard: it returns the path or
raises ``RepoNotConfigured``, which the HMAC middleware converts to the 409
``repo_not_configured`` boundary.

Two enforcement tiers (same pattern as ``test_apps_instances_loop_offload.py``):

- Behavior tests: ``_repo()`` raises on the empty sentinel and returns the
  path otherwise, preserving the exception type the middleware boundary maps.
- AST ratchet: outside the accessor itself, a ``MAIN_REPO`` load may appear
  ONLY as a bare truthiness guard (``if MAIN_REPO:`` / ``not MAIN_REPO`` / a
  ``BoolOp`` operand). Any other load — a git argv element, a subprocess
  ``cwd=``, a ``Path(...)`` build, an f-string interpolation, a payload
  field — fails this test, so a future call site cannot silently reintroduce
  the fail-open shape.
