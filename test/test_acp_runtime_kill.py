    These tests describe the POSIX-shaped teardown, so the module they run

    production read of an attribute nobody thought to list raised
    ``AttributeError`` from inside the code under test, and the list went stale
    the moment the teardown started reading one more thing (the root-identity
    check). Delegating instead means only the pins are fiction.

    Every destructive entry point is pinned to ``None`` rather than delegated, so
    a test that forgets to stub one fails loudly on a call to ``None`` instead of
    aiming a real terminate at a fabricated pid on the host running the suite.
    Reads (``get_process_start_id``, ``pid_exists`` where a test sets it, the
    signal constants) come from the real module. Assignment lands on the
