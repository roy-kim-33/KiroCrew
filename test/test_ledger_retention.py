"""Ledger retention -- one test per rule the sweep and the removal promise.

Two layers, in the order they depend on each other: ``remove_unit`` (ownership,
ordering, identity last, counted failures) and ``sweep_expired`` (which units it
selects, and every unit it must refuse to touch).

The refusals carry the weight here. A sweep that removes too little costs disk;
a sweep that removes an OPEN session's log, a crew ledger, or a unit some writer
still owns destroys a record nothing can rebuild -- so each of those has its own
test rather than being covered incidentally by the happy path.
