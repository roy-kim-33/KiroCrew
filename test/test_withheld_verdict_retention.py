"""A withheld review verdict is retained where no later run can overwrite it.

A review lane that computes a verdict and cannot publish it holds that verdict
only in the job's own filesystem. Neither carrier the board has can keep it:
the lane's marker comment is updated IN PLACE, so a later run's body takes the
slot, and a check-run's conclusion and annotations are superseded by the next
attempt's. Both are also the only places the verdict's existence is recorded, so
losing the carrier loses the fact that a verdict was ever reached.

That gap is not hypothetical. On one pull request a fenced blocking verdict was
reported at one time and absent at another on the SAME head with no code change
between them, because a body edit re-ran the lane and the second sample did not
re-report the finding. Nothing had adjudicated the first verdict away; the only
record of it was a carrier that got rewritten.

A workflow artifact is neither rewritten nor replaced: it is written once under a
name unique to one run and one attempt. So the lanes retain a withheld verdict
there, and these tests hold three properties:

* the artifact carries the verdict's full text, not a summary of it;
* a second run on the same head adds a record BESIDE the first rather than
  replacing it;
* the record is reachable from the pull request side -- named in an annotation,
  and derivable from the head SHA alone so that a replaced annotation does not
  strand it.

The lanes are DISCOVERED from source rather than listed. The recurrence this
guards against is a review lane added later that publishes a verdict and never
wires the retention in, and a hardcoded list cannot fail for a lane that is not
on it.
