"""The wake judge's calibration feedback loop.

Four things are under test and they are separable on purpose: the deterministic
labelling rule, the three states a verdict row can be in, the retroactive pass that
credits a run of suppressed verdicts to the delivery that followed them, and the
elapsed-time context the state carries.

The three states matter most, because two of them look alike and are not. A verdict
that WITHHELD the turn is eligible for a `missed` label. A verdict whose turn was
CONFIRMED delivered is eligible for `owner_acted`. A verdict that decided to wake but
whose fire was refused, cancelled or lost is neither, and labelling it would hand one
turn's actions to a verdict that never produced it.

Every case here drives pure functions with literals. The service wiring is exercised
through ``AutoNudgeService`` only where the behaviour IS the wiring -- a loop record
that survives a round trip, and the turn-completion hook labelling the delivery it
ends.
