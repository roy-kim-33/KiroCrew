"""Folder steering reader: inclusion rules, skip rules, dedup, root containment.

``collect_folder_steering`` is the ONE reader of a chat's folder-inherited
steering roots, so every rule the Context_Builder relies on is pinned here: the
``inclusion`` filter, the double-load skip for project and global steering, the
realpath dedup across roots, the per-file admissibility check against the
declared root as trust base, and the debug-and-skip degradation for a missing
directory or an unreadable file.

Properties 1 and 2 of the design are the two ``hypothesis`` tests at the end:
the resolver's root-first / deduplicated / cycle-safe walk, and the collector's
dedup + skip + containment + order stability over real temporary trees.
