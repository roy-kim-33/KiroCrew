"""The ``kirocrew-debug`` MCP server: its tool set, its caps, and its refusals.

Five things are pinned here that no other suite can see:

* **The tool set is exactly five READS.** The server reads host and cross-session
  state, so a write tool would be the one addition that changes what the set IS.
  The names are ratcheted: adding one fails this file rather than shipping.
* **No ``autoApprove``, structurally.** An autoApproved MCP tool is approved inside
  kiro-cli and emits no permission request, so ``hooks.on_tool_call`` -- the deny
  floor, the sensitive-path check, the governance ceiling -- is never reached for
  it. For a server this wide that is not a style preference.
* **The diag gap is relayed VERBATIM.** Three tools depend on a package that lands
  in sibling changes. An agent must be able to tell "this build cannot answer yet"
  from "the answer is nothing", so the 501 body and the relayed message are pinned
  to the same string here.
* **The refusal classifier separates a timeout from a match.** This is the most
  consequential line of the whole feature: a path the resolver could not finish
  judging reads identically to a real match, and an agent that confuses them stops
  when it should have retried.
* **Every failure is a typed code**, never a traceback and never prose alone.
