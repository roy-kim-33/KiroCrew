"""Liveness tests for the shell-command sensitive-path gate.

``is_sensitive_bash_command`` runs synchronously on the gateway's event loop,
under a loop-stall watchdog that hard-exits the process after 25 s of silence
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``). A field crash (a cron whose agent
emitted a ~9 KB command full of ``https://`` URLs) traced to the gate: the
doubled separator in every URL sent the command through the separator-collapsed
re-scan, and the pattern tier was quadratic in the command. Three constructs
were each quadratic on their own and their costs multiply, so each has its own
pin here, plus the two trigger paths the crash dumps showed:

* Pass 1b -- ~10 KB with doubled separators (the URL / ``//`` shape);
* Pass 1  -- one 24 000-backslash run, which never reaches the loop at all.

Verdict pins are the cases where the rewritten construct was the ONLY branch
that matched, captured from the pre-rewrite gate on this tree and on the tree
before the anchor rewrite (#7941); a 381 474-command generated differential
corpus produced zero differences against both. Timing tests assert a doubling
RATIO where the code has no structure to observe, with the input well inside
the region where the old shape was already seconds, so a regression overshoots
by 4x while noise moves the linear result by a fraction.
