"""The transcript budget one history consolidation prompt carries.

The unconsolidated tail has no natural ceiling: a session that goes a long time
between passes, or whose consolidation kept failing, accumulates every message
since the marker and renders all of them into a single prompt. Past some length
no provider accepts that prompt, so the span that most needs extracting becomes
the one that can never be extracted.

Bounding the prompt is only half of it. The durable ``last_consolidated`` marker
is what says a message has been through a memory pass, so it has to follow the
PROMPT rather than the snapshot — on the success path and on the abandon path
alike. These tests pin the split, the separator accounting, the oversized-message
case, and that no offset ever advances past what a model actually read.
