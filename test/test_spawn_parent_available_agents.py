"""The parent agent's ``toolsSettings.subagent.availableAgents`` gates ``spawn_run``.

kiro-cli defines that key for its own built-in ``subagent`` tool: a glob list
of the agents THIS agent may spawn, and omitting it allows all. Kiro Crew's
sub-agents come through ``spawn_run`` / ``spawn_sub_agents`` instead, whose
admission only ever asked "does the target exist" plus Kiro Crew's own
governance -- so an operator who declared the allowlist on their agent spec
saw it silently ignored and the spawn tool advertised every installed agent as
valid.

Fixture (the reproduction from the triage): an ``orchestrator`` spec that
declares ``availableAgents: [agent1, agent2, agent3]`` (and, to prove the two
keys are not confused, the same names under ``trustedAgents``), the three named
agents, and a ``rogue`` agent that is installed but not in the list.

Contract pinned here:

* ``rogue`` is REFUSED with ``AGENT_NOT_AVAILABLE_CODE`` when the parent is
  ``orchestrator``; ``agent1`` is admitted.
* A parent whose spec OMITS ``availableAgents`` admits everything it did
  before -- the control that proves no undeclared user's behaviour moves.
* ``trustedAgents`` alone is NOT an allowlist (upstream semantics: it means
  "run without approval prompts").
* The gate is an intersection with governance, never a replacement for it.
