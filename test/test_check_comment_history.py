"""The comment-history gate must be real, wired into CI, and ratchet-only.

``docs/system-specs/common/code-style.md`` forbids change history in comments and
docstrings. ``scripts/check_comment_history.py`` is what makes that rule
enforceable. These tests pin the halves that must stay true together: CI actually
runs the gate (a gate that exists only on disk is not a gate), the detector reads
comments and docstrings but NOT ordinary string literals, and the baseline can
only shrink -- no operation may add a path or raise a count.
