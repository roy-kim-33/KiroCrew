"""Ratchet: the number of places that read a runtime's pid only goes down.

A `kiro-cli` runtime is one operating-system process owned by the pool that
spawned it, and a session holds a lease on it rather than its pid. Several
sessions may hold leases on one runtime, so a pid identifies a process and
answers nothing about which session is using it. "One session, one process" is
the layout a pool cap of 1 produces, not a property the code may rely on.

Every site this test counts is therefore a place where a shared process is
attributed to one of its tenants: a signal, an RSS reading, a liveness test, a
resource name or an identity lookup that is wrong for every other session on the
same process. At a pool cap of 1 each reading happens to coincide with the right
answer, which is what lets such a site look correct in review and in manual
testing.

The count is asserted EXACTLY, not as a ceiling. A ceiling accumulates slack: a
change that removes ten readers buys room for ten new ones, and the regression
this test exists to refuse then passes. So a change that removes a site records
the new number in the same commit, and the failure message says which number to
write.

Two families are counted, because a reader has two spellings. An attribute or
call is matched as text, with comments and string literals blanked first so prose
naming a reader is not a site. A reflective read names the reader in a string
literal -- ``getattr(client, "process_instance", "")`` -- and is resolved through
``ast`` instead, which sees a receiver that is itself a call
(``getattr(getattr(p, "client", None), "_pid", None)``) and a call the formatter
wrapped across lines. A text match cannot span either shape, and each shape is a
way to keep a reading while lowering the number.

Two readings are legitimate: the module that owns a runtime, and the one function
that ends it. Those mark their own lines rather than raising the total, and the
number of marked sites is pinned too -- otherwise marking an ordinary reader would
quietly buy a slot, and the exact-count message would even congratulate the author
for removing one.

A ratchet is only worth its number if it cannot pass vacuously, so the total is
not asserted alone: every needle must find a site, files known to hold sites must
still hold them, and the exemption is exercised end to end against a fixture tree
so deleting its branch fails a test. A scanner that silently stops matching
reports zero offenders, which reads exactly like success.
