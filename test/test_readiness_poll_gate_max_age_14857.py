"""The ``/api/sessions/usage`` readiness gate must not re-probe on every poll.

``/api/sessions/usage`` is polled every 30s by the credit pill. It passes
through ``reject_if_kiro_unverified`` -> ``verified_ready``, which re-runs a full
``whoami`` probe inline whenever the readiness latch is older than its max-age. A
max-age equal to the poll interval means the latch is expired at almost every
poll, so each poll pays for a forced probe inline -- the 5-12 s server waits the
credit pill exhibits.

The fix: ``/api/sessions/usage`` reads on a max-age comfortably longer than its
poll interval (and safe because its spawn is already throttled to one fetch per
600s), so a healthy latch authorizes many polls between probes. Everything
else -- the destructive-rerun paths (regenerate / edit-resend / rewind),
``/v1/chat/completions``, and the degraded-only ``/api/models`` poll -- keeps the
tight 30s max-age.
