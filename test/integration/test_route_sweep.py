"""Every route the router serves, swept for its guard and its fresh-home answer.

The routes are read from the live router at boot (``gw.registered_routes()``),
so a route added anywhere in the dashboard is swept the next time this runs,
and a route that stops being guarded or starts failing on a fresh home is
named by path. Four sweeps. Two over the parameter-less GETs:

* GUARDED -- without credentials the route answers 401 or 403. The routes that
  answer anything else unauthenticated are listed in ``UNGUARDED_GET`` with
  the status each answers and the reason; a route that is not listed and
  answers outside 401/403 is a guard regression, and a route that is listed
  and stops answering its status is a broken liveness, pre-login or asset
  contract.
* SERVES -- with credentials the route does not fail with a 5xx on a fresh
  home. The routes that answer 503 on a fresh home are listed in
  ``UNAVAILABLE_ON_A_FRESH_HOME`` with what each says is unavailable; a route
  that is listed must still answer 503 with that JSON ``error``, a route that
  is not listed must answer below 500, and a 500 is never a contract.

Two small exclusion tables carry the routes the SERVES sweep cannot judge:
``HELD_OPEN`` (a long-poll or SSE response that does not end) and
``REACHES_NETWORK`` (a fetch the rootdir conftest fences, or a call to the
operator's cloud account the harness fences). Every table is exact paths
with a reason; nothing is pattern- or prefix-excluded. The GUARDED sweep
skips nothing: the held-open and network routes answer 401/403 at once
without credentials, and are asserted to.

And two over everything else -- every mutating route and every route with a
path parameter, with ``STAND_IN`` substituted for each ``{token}`` (or the
``CONSTRAINED_STAND_IN`` value where the route's regex would refuse it):

* GUARDED, again -- without credentials every one of them answers 401 or
  403, the mutating ones with no body, so the guard is proven to run before
  any handler could act. The six that answer otherwise are ``UNGUARDED_OTHER``
  with the status and the reason (URL-token routes, the PWA asset route, an
  idempotent logout, an inbound webhook with its own signature auth).
* UNKNOWN ID -- with credentials, every parameterized GET asked for an id
  that does not exist answers below 500: 404 is the contract, 403/400/200
  are how some routes say it, a 5xx never is. ``HELD_OPEN_PARAM`` carries the
  one stream; ``UNKNOWN_ID_ANSWERS_5XX`` carries the routes that answer 5xx
  today, each with its tracking issue, and an entry comes out when the
  status moves below 500.

#: the handler does not catch (it is not a network error), so the fenced answer
#: is a 500 that says nothing about the product. The cloud preflight shells the
#: real ``aws`` CLI four times against whatever ``~/.aws`` resolves; the
#: harness points the CLI at credential files that do not exist, so on a

#: and the route is judged by its own tests, not by this sweep.

#: ``/api/models`` is deliberately NOT here: this suite's fresh home runs the fake
#: kiro-cli (``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` in the integration conftest), which answers

#: empty model list. It is swept by the default rule below — under 500 — which
