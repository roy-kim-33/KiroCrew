"""The sensitive-path gates must never block the event loop on a stalled mount.

Field report (macOS, 0.6.x): ten identical watchdog crash dumps, the loop
parked in ``posixpath._joinrealpath`` under ``on_tool_call ->
is_sensitive_bash_command -> ... -> _candidate_forms``.  The tool call was
``ssh host 'cd /home/<user>/ws && ...'``; the gate ``realpath``'d the REMOTE
path token locally, ``/home`` on macOS is an autofs map answered by
opendirectoryd, and the directory server was unreachable during a VPN
transition -- so ``lstat`` blocked in the kernel for longer than the watchdog
budget.  No exception, so the ``except OSError`` never fired.  Widening the
watchdog budget from 25s to 90s only moved the crash.

These tests pin the fix: resolution is bounded; a stall is FAIL-CLOSED (the
gate refuses the path rather than matching its lexical spelling, so a
workspace symlink into a credential store cannot ride a stall); the cooldown a
stall opens is scoped to the stalled path prefix, so one wedged mount costs
one timeout per window without switching resolution off anywhere else; and a
resolution that merely FAILS (OSError) still falls back to the lexical forms,
which must fence a symlinked ``$HOME`` by its logical spelling.
