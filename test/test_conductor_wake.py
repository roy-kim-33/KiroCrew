"""The crew-log wake: a worker's write, close or turn end pulls its conductor forward.

``rfc-crew-log-wake``. One lookup (``conductor_wake``) and three triggers that share it.
What is pinned here is the WIRING -- that each trigger resolves the binding, finds the
conductor's armed work-ledger loop and calls ``fire_now`` on it, and that none of them
fires for a slot with no binding. What the conductor then DOES with the tick is Phase 3's
gate and is pinned in ``test_probe_work_ledger.py``; the one piece of that this file does
own is the ``worker_closed`` probe input, because it is this change's addition to the
staleness conjunction.

No gateway runs in any of these. The service is a stub with the three attributes the
lookup reads, which is what makes a wiring defect here impossible to mistake for a
service defect.
