"""Tests for unlinking a PR/issue/Jira source-link chip from a chat session.

The chips are DERIVED by re-scanning the transcript, so a naive delete is undone
by the next re-scan. Unlinking instead records the link's serialized identity in
a per-slot dismissed set that the derivation filters against, persists it so a
restart cannot resurrect the chip, and touches no remote provider.

    ``dismissed_source_links`` is slot-owned metadata mirrored into
    ``_ChatSlot._dismissed_source_links``. Two different things can go wrong when
    a bind path forgets the mirror, and they are pinned separately here:

    * DISPLAY: the re-surfaced slot derives a chip the user unlinked. Fixed only
      by restoring on that path -- so every path that applies transcript
      metadata or rows is enumerated structurally and checked, and the three
      loaders the behavioural suite above did not already exercise directly
      (``_rehydrate_slot_from_history``, ``_apply_recent_session``, the resume
      endpoint) get an end-to-end restore test each.
    * ERASURE: the forgetful slot's next full save serialises its empty set over
      the transcript's real tombstones. This class is closed by the save paths
      themselves, which UNION memory with the on-disk line -- so a bind path that
      forgets to hydrate regresses to a stale chip, never to data loss. Pinned
