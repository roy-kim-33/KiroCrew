"""A doctor family reads every project module it uses through ``cli_doctor``, at call time.

The families load lazily, on the first read through the facade, so an import that binds a
project module by name in a family (``from kiro_crew import sandbox``) would take that
value at whatever moment the first read falls -- inside a test's rebind of
``kiro_crew.sandbox``, say -- and keep it for the rest of the process. It would also stop a
patch of the facade's own binding (``cli_doctor.sandbox``) from reaching the family, which
the one-module report honoured. So a family binds no project module but the facade and
its sibling families, and reads ``cli_doctor.<module>.<name>`` where it needs one.
