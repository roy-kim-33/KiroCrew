"""``LocalMemoryFiles`` reproduces what ``MemoryStore``'s private methods did.

The ``MemoryFiles`` seam moved memory's admission gates, hardened reader and
atomic writer out of ``MemoryStore`` and behind an extension point. The claim
that came with that move is that the PUBLIC edition's behaviour is unchanged --
and a claim like that is only worth something if something fails when it stops
being true.

The suites that already cover this surface (``test_memory.py``,
``test_memory_markdown_read.py``) exercise it THROUGH ``MemoryStore``, so they
would also pass if the local implementation quietly relaxed a guarantee that
``MemoryStore`` happened to re-establish on its own. These tests therefore go
straight at ``LocalMemoryFiles``, one class of guarantee at a time, and assert
the observable artefacts -- the bytes on disk, the permission bits, the absence
of a temp file, the target of a planted link being untouched -- rather than that
a call returned without raising.

Each test names the property it pins, because a future implementation of this
protocol has to satisfy the PROPERTY, and the local specifics (an ``O_NOFOLLOW``
open, an inode's link count) are only how this one implementation achieves it.
