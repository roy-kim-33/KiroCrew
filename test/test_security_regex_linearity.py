"""Differential + complexity guards for the two ``security.py`` linearity fixes.

Both fixes are performance-only and MUST be behaviour-preserving, so the tests
here are written as *differentials*: the expected values were captured from the
implementation as it stood immediately BEFORE each change (origin/main
``760d8f570``) and are pinned as literals. A verdict or byte that moves in either
direction fails.

Covered:

* Mesh-3654 -- ``redact_credentials`` pass 1 was ``for m in
  _CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS.finditer(result): result = result.replace(...)``, which
  rebuilt the whole string per match (O(n^2) on credential-dense text). It is now
  a single ``_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS.sub(...)``. The redacted text AND the
  ``warnings`` list (content *and* order) must be unchanged.
* Mesh-3693 -- eleven branches of the sensitive-path regex were anchored
  ``(?:^|.*[\\s'\\"=:,;])``. The leading ``.*`` is redundant under ``re.search``
  (which retries at every offset) and made matching quadratic in the longest
  line. The anchor is now ``(?:^|[\\s'\\"=:,;])``. This is a DENY surface, so the
  verdict tests below replay positives and negatives to make it obvious that
  nothing became more permissive.

    """Complexity-class guard for Mesh-3693 -- a calibrated ratio, not a wall clock.

    A long newline-free non-shell string is the worst case for the old anchor:
    eleven branches each retried a greedy ``.*`` from every offset. Earlier
    versions of this test pinned an absolute ceiling (6 s, then 20 s) derived
    from one dev box (~1.5-2.0 s fixed, ~27 s pre-fix -- history only). A loaded
    16-worker CI shard then took 6.54 s down the FIXED path and failed a PR whose
    diff could not touch the measured code: an absolute ceiling mis-attributes
    runner slowness as a complexity regression (#8374).

    A naive two-size ratio (the 20 KB timing over the 10 KB one) does NOT work
    here, by measurement:
    the anchor's per-separator work inside the large alternation makes even the
    fixed form scale ~4x per input doubling on this blob shape, the same
    doubling signature as the quadratic form -- only the CONSTANT separates them
    (~14-20x at equal size). So the guard is the issue's other suggestion, a
    same-run measured baseline: compile a deliberately quadratic REFERENCE from
    the live pattern (the exact ``.*`` spelling Mesh-3693 removed) and require
    the live pattern to beat it by a wide factor on the same input in the same
    run. Live and reference samples are INTERLEAVED at equal repetitions and
    compared min-to-min, so a contention burst lands on both sides instead of
    biasing one; the runner's constant slowness multiplies both minima and
    cancels out of the ratio. If the ``.*`` comes back, live == reference and
    the ratio collapses to ~1x, far below the bar.

    Scope, stated plainly: this ratio detects the leading-``.*`` regression
    class specifically. A quadratic blowup of a DIFFERENT shape (say a nested
    quantifier added elsewhere in the alternation) slows live and reference
    together and can pass the ratio; such shapes are covered only by the
    backstop below and by :func:`test_sensitive_anchor_has_no_leading_wildcard`,
    which reads the anchor out of the source and cannot flake at all -- keep
    that one primary.

    The absolute backstop is SELF-CALIBRATING: the cap scales with the same-run
    quadratic reference timing (never below 60 s), so a runner slow enough to
    inflate the healthy path inflates the cap with it -- unlike the fixed
    ceilings this test used to have. It detects, not prevents: it runs after the
    measured call returns, so a truly unbounded hang is bounded by the CI job
    timeout, not by this assert.

    The blob is sized just UNDER ``MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS``, because the gate
    now refuses a longer command without scanning it: above the ceiling both the
    verdict assertion and the backstop below would measure the refusal rather than
    the anchor, and the guard would pass no matter what the pattern costs. The
    refusal itself is pinned in ``test_security_gate_liveness.py``.
