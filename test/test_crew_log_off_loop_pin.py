"""No async test touches a crew log from the event-loop thread.

A crew log is guarded by a per-unit file lock, and two background threads take it on
their own schedule: the writer that lands every append, and the eager folder that
reads the unit right after each entry. ``file_lock`` takes one attempt and never waits
on the event-loop thread, so a crew-log call made straight from an ``async def`` is
refused whenever one of those threads holds the lock -- at random, on whichever shard
is slow that day. A refused write raises ``CrewLedgerNotRecorded``; a refused read
raises ``OSError`` or, where the reader is best-effort, quietly answers an empty record.
Product callers make these calls through ``asyncio.to_thread``.

This pin reads every test module and fails on an ``async def`` that makes one of the
calls in ``_CREW_LOG_CALLS`` directly, or calls a sync helper in the same module that
does. A helper that hands the call to ``off_loop`` (``test/off_loop_helpers.py``) or
``asyncio.to_thread`` only REFERENCES it, so it does not count. ``_ON_LOOP_ON_PURPOSE``
lists the tests whose subject is the on-loop refusal itself.
