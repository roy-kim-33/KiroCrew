"""An ABSENT crew-home ceiling is still sealed read-only by the Linux launcher.

``mount(2)`` cannot target a path that does not exist, so the ``READONLY_DIRS`` loop's
``if os.path.exists(target)`` guard silently skips a ceiling that has never been written
— and on a default install that is most of them, which left the data home writable at
exactly the names the seal exists to protect. ``_materialize_sealable_ceilings()`` closes
that by creating the absent ceiling first, but only for the leaves that clear both tests
the production comment states: an empty document must mean what an absent file means, and
a STALE read of it must fail toward refusal.

The load-bearing test here is
:meth:`TestSealAppliesToAPreviouslyAbsentCeiling.test_bind_and_remount_pair_is_emitted`:
it executes the launcher's own seal loop (extracted from the generated script, so the
production source is what runs) against a real filesystem, with ``_mount_or_die``
replaced by a recorder. Delete the materialiser and that loop records nothing, because
the guard falls through — which is the whole defect.

:class:`TestCeilingsThatMustNotBeMaterialized` is the fence in the opposite direction,
and it is the one to read before adding a leaf: three ceilings read a present-but-empty
file as something other than absent, and a fourth would be pinned stale in the dangerous
direction by the bind mount itself.

    ``denied_commands.json`` reads ``{}`` as its absent default, but a bind mount pins
    the INODE while every dashboard writer publishes a NEW one through ``atomic_write``,
    so a sealed stub would report "nothing is denied" to in-sandbox ``mcp_cron`` for the
    rest of the sandbox's life. The other three read a present-but-empty file as
    something other than absent: ``security_policy.json`` raises
    ``PlatformCompositionError`` out of ``governance.load_security_policy`` (which reruns
    at boot and per app callback), ``app_admission.json`` flips ``open_default()`` into
    deny-all, and ``admission_policy.json`` is already seeded at first run.
