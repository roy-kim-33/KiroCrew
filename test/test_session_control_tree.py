"""The two verbs that move a session in the tree: ``session_adopt`` / ``session_release``.

Split from the other session-control tests because what they can get wrong is
different. The send and stop verbs act on a target's WORK; these act on where the
sidebar puts it, so the failures worth catching are an authorization that admits the
wrong caller and a record that says the tree moved when it did not.

Every refusal is asserted against the REAL slot objects, the same rule the rest of the
session-control suite follows: the guards read ``memory_mode`` / ``workspace`` / ``_app``
off the production class, and a permissive double would let a dead guard look alive.
