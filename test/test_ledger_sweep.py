"""Ledger cleanup sweep — the refuse-safe rules, one test per rule.

Pins what docs/system-specs/modules/session-work-ledger.md §2 "Cleanup" states:
a dry run lists and deletes nothing; a purge removes only what the report named;
an in-flight session ledger and a conductor holding an open item are never
candidates at any age; the threshold is a boundary rather than a hint; an
unreadable record is listed but survives a plain purge; a conductor holding no
items is kept at any age; a terminal session ledger written to recently is not
old; and the window has one owner, so the CLI default cannot drift from the
module's.

Note on the fixtures: ``session_ledger.record`` appends to the session's crew log,
and the session ledger's record is a fold of those entries. The on-disk
``<data home>/ledger/<store>/state.json`` document is LEGACY residue that nothing
writes; ``ledger_sweep`` still governs it, so these fixtures build such a
store directly on disk (see :func:`_legacy_session_store`) instead of going
through ``record``.
