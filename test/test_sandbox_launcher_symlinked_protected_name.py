"""A symlinked protected name keeps working, and a SUBSTITUTED one refuses.

The launcher's hiding mounts resolve each protected name to decide what to mask.
Two layouts put a symlink at such a name, and they need OPPOSITE answers:

* an ordinary ``stow`` or ``chezmoi`` dotfile layout, where ``~/.ssh`` has been a
  link to the user's own store since before the gateway started. Refusing it
  would fail every strict spawn on a supported machine, so it must WORK -- the
  mask follows the link once and covers the store the keys actually live in;
* a link SUBSTITUTED for a directory while the launcher is looking, which is the
  redirect: the mask lands on the planter's decoy while the real directory,
  renamed aside, stays readable.

Nothing at a single instant separates them, which is why the launcher does not
try: it carries the identity of what occupied the name at its FIRST look and
refuses when a later look finds a different occupant. A link that was already
there is the same link at both looks and passes; a directory replaced by a link
is not, and refuses.

The ``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`` shape a no-follow fix reaches for first is
measured here as the thing that breaks the supported layout, so the refusal it
would cause cannot creep back in unnoticed.
