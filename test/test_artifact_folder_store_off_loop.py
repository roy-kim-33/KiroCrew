"""Every artifact-folder-store call an HTTP handler makes runs off the loop.

``ArtifactFolderStore`` guards its whole API with one ``threading.Lock``, and
every mutating call — ``create``, ``rename``, ``reparent``, ``set_icon``,
``delete`` — holds that lock across ``_save()``: ``mkdir`` + ``mkstemp`` +
write + ``os.fsync`` + ``os.replace``. The handlers already push those
mutations into the shared executor, which is exactly what makes the READS
dangerous to leave inline: a read on the gateway loop can only take the lock
once the worker thread finishes somebody else's folder write, so the loop
stalls for the length of that filesystem write.

So the property pinned here is not "the read is fast" — it is *which thread
the store call actually ran on*. Each test wraps the real store methods,
records ``threading.get_ident()`` per call, and asserts no call landed on the
event loop's own thread. Recording inside the store (rather than asserting on
the handler's shape) keeps the tests true no matter how a handler reaches it.

Harness mirrors ``test_artifact_folder_handlers.py``: MagicMock requests and a
real store rooted under ``tmp_path``.
