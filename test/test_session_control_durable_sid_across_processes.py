"""The id recorded for another slot survives a real process boundary.

Every other test of this resolution runs in one interpreter, where the session map is
in memory and answers for as long as that process lives -- so a resolver reading only
the map passes them all. The gap it is there to close opens at a RESTART: the slot whose
log a takeover names can be one this process has never served a turn for, and the map is
then either silent or naming a generation the slot has left behind.

So the store is written here and read THERE, in an interpreter that has mapped nothing.
The subprocess is the assertion; this module only sets up a store and reports what came
back. It is one test because the boundary is the expensive part, and it carries its own
control: the same child also reports what the session map answers, so a pass cannot be
explained by the map having been consulted.

#: the resolver's answer per slot and, as the control, what the session map holds --

#: ``sessions`` stands in for the live registry, which genuinely does not exist here: no

#: ``has_session`` answers False rather than being left off the stub. Left off, the
