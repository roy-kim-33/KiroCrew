"""On macOS the runtime memory ceilings read the footprint, not ``ps`` RSS.

The background runtime's 500 MiB ceiling (``AcpRuntime._is_stale``) judged the
macOS tree by ``ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,rss=``. ``ps`` RSS counts only pages resident
right now; macOS compresses and swaps idle pages aggressively, and those pages
are exactly what an idle runtime that has grown is made of. jetsam and Activity
Monitor's "Memory" column read ``phys_footprint`` instead, which includes them.
Measured on an operator Mac: a gateway at 124 MB ``ps`` RSS against 1983 MB
footprint (16x), and two idle runtimes holding 462 MB of footprint for hours
while the ceiling never fired.

These pin the footprint reader (``proc_pid_rusage(RUSAGE_INFO_V2)``, no
subprocess), that the macOS tree sum uses it per pid with ``ps`` RSS as the
per-pid fallback, and that the ceiling therefore fires on a tree whose RSS is
small and whose footprint is not.
