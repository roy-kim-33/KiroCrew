"""Tests for shared-MCP-gateway delivery via ACP ``session/new`` injection.

The pooling mechanism under test: kiro-cli honours a server injected in
``session/new`` AHEAD of the same-named entry in the resolved agent spec, so
injecting broker stubs pools an agent's servers without writing a spec into the
user's project, their ``~/.kiro/agents/``, or a bind mount.

``test_real_kiro_cli_prefers_session_injected_server`` is the anti-drift guard:
that precedence is verified but undocumented, so it is pinned against the
shipped binary — but only when a human sets ``KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO_CLI=1``,
because that guard spawns the operator's real, credentialed CLI. See ``REAL_CLI``.

    A site may say it either way: an explicit ``work_dir=`` or a

#: interactive browser login for any subcommand with no env var to suppress it
#: (acp-client.md). Gating on ``PATH`` presence alone therefore made a bare

    ``overlay_project_scope`` answers ``markdown_specs=False`` for the kiro backend
    because kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` from the checkout ITSELF and discovers the
    JSON form there. If a release starts discovering project ``*.md``, that file
    becomes the agent a session runs while the decider still says JSON-only: the
    user-level overlay's stub for that name survives, outranks the project's own
    declaration, and mounts its command and credentials under the checkout's agent.
    That is the defect this PR exists to close, so it must not come back silently.

    The repo's own documents cannot settle it -- the vendored upstream reference
    describes the IDE 1.0 / CLI 3.0 schema and says the filename without ``.json``
    or ``.md`` becomes the agent name, while ``agent_spec_format``'s header records
    markdown as the v3 engine's form -- which is why this asks the binary. Measured
    on 2.22.0: exactly one workspace agent, the JSON one.

    ``agent list`` reads the filesystem and prints; it starts no session and needs
    no credential, so this is the cheapest honest instrument. It is still gated,
    because ``REAL_CLI`` exists to keep presence on PATH from reading as consent.

    Fails TOWARD the remedy: when a CLI does discover project markdown, the fix is
    to make that backend a member of ``ACP_BACKENDS_MARKDOWN_AGENT_SPECS``, which
    is what the containment pin in ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` then requires.
