"""A sandbox that refuses to initialize must fail fast and name the layer.

A host whose OS sandbox cannot be built reported only the downstream symptom --
the agent process exited -- while the cause sat one line earlier on the child's
stderr (``sandbox initialization failed: Operation not permitted``). The death
summary now carries that tail, so the line is at least visible, but the failure
is still treated as a transport fault: the reconnect ladder respawns, the same
host refuses identically, and every entry in the UI crash-loops.

The refusal is DETERMINISTIC, which is the whole argument. The repo already has
the shape for that -- ``AcpAuthRequired`` and ``AcpToolGateUnroutable`` are
non-retryable because respawning hits the same wall -- and this is the third
member of that family.

Two things are asserted, and the second is the one that makes the error useful:

* exactly ONE spawn attempt, and a classified type rather than a generic death;
* the layer that wrapped the spawn, plus a remedy whose STRENGTH matches the
  evidence. Signature alone cannot supply the layer: a harness's internal sandbox
  nested inside Crew's wrap fails with the HARNESS's wording while the layer the
  operator must change is CREW's, which is how the field reports were actually
  resolved. So the layer comes from the argv Kiro Crew itself built.

  The switch that turns a layer OFF is a separate question, and the stderr cannot
  answer it: the dead child is the unverified binary the sandbox exists to
  contain, so a planted one could otherwise print a refusal and talk the operator
  into removing the isolation it runs under. The switch is emitted only on a
  verdict from a TRUSTED launcher run.

A control tail must stay retryable throughout. ``Operation not permitted`` and
``Failed to spawn child process`` are ordinary output for a missing binary or a
denied credential file, and latching a permanent verdict onto those would delete
retries that work today.
