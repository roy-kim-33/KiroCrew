"""Strict-identity diagnostics: the refusal names its cause, and doctor reports it.

Two surfaces are under test, and they exist for two different readers:

1. :func:`kiro_crew.mcp_core.strict_identity_diagnosis` — the reader who just
   had a tool refused. Every strict refusal already said WHAT was refused; none
   said why THIS install cannot answer "which session is calling", so there was
   no next step. The diagnosis is appended to the refusal text.
2. ``cli_doctor._doctor_strict_identity`` — the reader doing a checkup before
   hitting the wall.

Both are REPORTS. ``mcp_gateway.stub_servers`` is empty by default on purpose
(routing starts a broker plus a stub per server), so neither surface repairs
anything.
