"""The sandbox chokepoint's tool marker, and the separation its meaning rests on.

A tree spawned through :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.sandboxed_spawn_argv` lands in this
install's agent slice carrying the inherited ``KIROCREW_SPAWNED`` ownership marker and
appears in no membership record the runtime reconciler reads. Once such a tree outlives
the reconciler's age floor -- a LaTeX build, an ``npx`` install, a provisioning run --
the argv0 basename test is the only thing between it and a signal.

``KIROCREW_SANDBOX_TOOL`` is the evidence that replaces the name: stamped by the
chokepoint, inherited by the whole tree, and read back out of the kernel's exec-time
copy, which a same-uid process cannot alter on another process.

The marker describes a TREE, not each process in it, and the chokepoint takes harness
argv on purpose -- ``is_kiro_cli`` exists so a delegating spawn can route through it.
So a harness can carry the marker two ways: routed through the chokepoint directly, or
spawned inside a marked tool tree. Either way it is an orphaned harness in the slice,
in no record, past the age floor -- the one stray class this arm can reach. That is why
the exclusion requires the marker AND a non-harness argv0, and why these tests pin the
harness-routing sites rather than a separation that does not exist.
