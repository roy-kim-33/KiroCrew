"""The tool layer for `session_broadcast` and `session_status`: what it forwards,
and what it reports back.

Both tools return PROSE the model reads and acts on, so the report is the contract.
Two shapes matter most and neither is visible from the API's own tests.

For a broadcast: partial delivery is the normal outcome, so a report that reads as
all-or-nothing is the defect — a model told "queued for 2 sessions" when three were
asked will not go looking for the third. Every row's outcome is asserted on its
own, including the steer that quietly fell back to a queue, for the reason
`session_send`'s own report separates them.

For a status listing: a short list means opposite things depending on how good the
durable read was, so the `tree` flag must reach the prose. A list rendered without
it lets a model conclude "you created one worker" from an answer that could not see
the other seven.
