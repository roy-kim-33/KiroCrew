"""The internal-API credential must stay paired with the port it guards.

The defect these cover: the credential is generated per gateway start and held in
memory as the value the auth middleware compares against, but it was published
only to one shared ``.local_secret`` per data home. A second gateway starting in
the same home replaced that file while the first kept serving, so every internal
caller then sent the newcomer's credential to the incumbent and the whole internal
channel answered 403 with a bare ``Forbidden`` until something restarted.
