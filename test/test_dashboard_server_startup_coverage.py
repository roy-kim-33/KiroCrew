"""Coverage tests for ``kiro_crew.dashboard.server``'s startup path.

Sibling of ``test_dashboard_server_coverage.py``, which pins the module's
extracted *helpers*. What was left uncovered is the one thing no helper test can
reach: the body of :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.server.start_dashboard` itself —
the app factory that wires every route, middleware and lifecycle hook the
gateway serves. Nothing asserted here is reachable from a helper, because the
wiring order and the hook/middleware inventory only exist inside that function.

The listener is never bound. ``start_dashboard`` builds
``web.TCPSite(runner, addr, port)`` and binds it inside ``_start_site``;
constructing the site is inert, so stubbing ``_start_site`` means no host port
is opened. That is the pattern the sibling module established for
``start_api_server`` — AUTOSDE ``no-test-side-effects`` is ``blocking: true`` and
an ephemeral ``port=0`` would not exempt a real bind.

Everything else that reaches outside the process is replaced rather than
tolerated: app-backend launches, the builtin-app registration sweep, the Kiro
prerequisite probe, the Playwright registration migration (which writes the
operator's REAL ``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``, outside ``KIROCREW_HOME``), the
terminal reaper (shells out to ``ps``) and the MCP probe. ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is
pinned to ``tmp_path`` by ``test/conftest.py``, so the state files the startup
writes stay inside the test's own directory.
