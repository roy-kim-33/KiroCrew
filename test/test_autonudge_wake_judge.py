    The order matters because the judge emits no terminal of its own. If it answered
    ahead of the monitor guard, a judged pull-request loop would return before
    ``irq.poll`` runs, nothing would be left to notice a merged or closed subject, and
    the watch would outlive the thing it watches, bounded only by its cycle cap.

    The judge therefore screens exactly one tick: the one the probe looked at and found
    nothing in. No typed signal can be suppressed there, because every outcome that
    means something -- terminal, wake, fallback, an interrupted poll, a drifted
    target -- has already returned by that line. What the judge adds is the evidence
    the probe cannot read, such as a review left in prose.
