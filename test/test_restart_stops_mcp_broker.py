"""The in-app restart paths stop the MCP broker this gateway owns before the exec.

``_shutdown`` stops the pooled MCP gateway broker on a clean exit, because
``gatewayd`` is spawned detached and would otherwise outlive the process that
started it. The two exec-based restart paths -- the dashboard's
``_restart_gateway`` and the update coordinator's ``_restart_after_update`` --
never ran that shutdown. They relied on the successor to adopt or replace the
survivor, and the successor can do that only when the daemon's recorded owner
pid is its own (an ``os.execv`` that kept the pid) or gone. Through a launcher
that runs the selected gateway as a supervised child, the old pid lives on as
the supervisor: the daemon's owner-liveness sweeper keeps finding a live owner
with an unchanged start time and never exits, and the successor's election meets
a daemon "owned by another LIVE gateway" -- refused for the whole generation, so
every stubbed server falls back to per-session exec and a daemon on the previous
code keeps its pooled backends running.

These tests pin the ordering on both paths (sessions closed, broker stopped,
exec), that a refused or deferred restart leaves the broker serving, and that a
broker which will not stop cannot strand a gateway whose sessions are already
closed.
