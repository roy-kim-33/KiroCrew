"""Cancel must reach a manual run from the instant Run accepted it.

``POST /api/crons/{id}/run`` hands the task it creates to the job's run claim
and returns; ``CronService.run_job`` then sits in its first ``await`` -- the
offloaded ``_synced_snapshot``, up to a full store-lock spin. ``cancel()``'s
guard reads that claim, so a claim taken only after that await opens a window
in which ``POST /api/crons/{id}/cancel`` answers 409 "job is not running"
while a second Run answers 409 "job is already running" about the same job,
and the run then executes anyway. The claim is therefore taken synchronously
while ``run_job(job_id)`` is evaluated, before the route's ``create_task`` has
scheduled anything.

The window is only open while the snapshot is held, which no product route
holds on demand, so this harness is the bar: a gate parks ``run_job``'s
refresh in its worker thread and the requests land inside the window.
