"""``kiro_crew/BUILD_VERSION`` -- a distribution's build stamp over ``__version__``.

The contract is the FILE (its name and the ``<base>.N`` shape), not a Python
API, so the helpers are private and imported here under test-local names.

A distribution that repackages one core release as several builds of its own
(``0.6.0.10``, ``0.6.0.11``, ... of the same ``0.6.0``) had no way to make the
running process say which one it was: the About page's version chip,
``/api/status``, ``/api/health``, ``kirocrew --version`` and the diagnostics
report all read ``kiro_crew.__version__``, several through an import-time copy
(``dashboard/handlers/updates.py::_local_version``, ``ws.py``) that nothing
after import can reach. The stamp is a file BESIDE ``kiro_crew/__init__.py``,
written at packaging time and resolved at import -- the one point that
precedes every copy -- and deliberately not an environment variable, which the
local operator could set to wave a forbidden build past the governance
minimum-version floor.

Pinned here: the shape rule (only the base, or the base plus ``.N`` numeric
segments over a bare numeric base, is honoured; anything else is refused with
a warning and the base stays); the file resolution (absent, blank, unreadable,
foreign, valid); and the reach -- in a fresh interpreter importing a package
that DECLARES A PINNED BARE RELEASE and carries the file, the dashboard's
import-time copies, ``version_display`` and ``--version`` all report the stamp,
and the governance floor sees it too. The reach half synthesizes the package it
imports, so this checkout's own ``__version__`` is not an input to any
assertion here -- see ``_PINNED_BASE``.
