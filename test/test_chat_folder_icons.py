"""Auto-generated and manual emoji icons on chat folders.

The generator (``generate_emoji_for_name``) is shared with the artifact
library and already covered elsewhere; these tests pin the CHAT-FOLDER wiring:

* create never generates an icon — an explicit ``icon`` value is stored,
  anything else means the default glyph,
* PATCH accepts ``icon`` (set / clear) and ``regenerate_icon`` (the explicit
  Auto-generate action, the only path that spawns generation), rejecting the
  two together,
* the write-back goes through ``mutate_folders`` and re-finds the folder by
  id, so a folder deleted mid-generation is never resurrected,
* app ownership gates icon writes exactly like every other folder field.
