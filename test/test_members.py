    """A refused append is REPORTED; an ordinary fault is not promoted to a report.

    ``crew_log.lease`` takes write ownership non-blocking, so two processes
    appending to one member at the same instant do not serialize -- the second is
    refused with ``already_owned`` and writes nothing. That is a lost entry, and
    the lease module states the caller's duty for it: report the loss rather than
    retry it. Both halves are pinned here, because a handler that reported EVERY
    failure would satisfy the first test while telling a reader nothing about
    which case they have.
