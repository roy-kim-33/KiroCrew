"""
The CodeBuild fleet routing decision -- same-repo run gets a per-run
`codebuild-kirocrew-gha-linux-<run_id>-<run_attempt>` label, a fork run (or a
run in any repository other than kirodotdev/KiroCrew) stays on
`ubuntu-latest` -- is hand-copied as one literal `runs-on:` expression into
every job that has no resolver job of its own to read an output from. A
`needs:` edge cannot cross a workflow file, and several of the copies (Fast
Gate's twelve gates) are FORBIDDEN a `needs:` edge even within their own file
(see test_fast_gate_barrier.py), so this repo has ~50 independent copies of
the same trust-boundary decision instead of one.

That is a real hole: a future fix to the fork rule applied to one copy and
missed the rest reintroduces exactly the vulnerability the fix closed, and
nothing short of reading every workflow file by hand would catch the miss.
This test is the single point that would catch it -- every occurrence of the
expression's literal text, across every workflow file, must be byte-identical
to the one canonical copy defined below, or this test fails and names which
file drifted.

`ci.yml`'s `changes` job resolver, and the jobs in other files that read its
`needs.changes.outputs.linux_runner`/`linux_runner_large` output rather than
carrying their own copy, are a DIFFERENT (and stricter -- see that job's own
`IS_FORK` env var, which computes the identical boolean) implementation of
the same decision and are named as exceptions below, not exempted from
scrutiny.

Five jobs are PERMANENT exceptions: they fit the migration's other criteria
but must stay on `ubuntu-latest` for a reason specific to each, recorded
both at the job's own `runs-on:` line and in `_PERMANENT_EXCEPTIONS` below.

# reads it before "fixing" the job back onto the fleet.
#
# - security-scope-review.yml's `generate`: its write fence hardcodes a
#   GitHub-hosted-runner path (`Write(//home/runner/work/_actions/**)`) that
#   the CodeBuild routing would silently bypass.
# - security-scope-review.yml's `validate` and `publish`: a diff limited to
#   this workflow's own `runs-on:` lines gives `generate`'s model no
#   shell/flow/cron surface to propose candidates for, so it writes an
#   honest empty `candidates.json`. `scope_candidates.py validate` treats
#   an empty candidate file the same as an untrustworthy one (exit 2, not
#   the exit-3 "nothing new" path, which specifically means candidates WERE
#   proposed and are already covered) -- deliberately, per
#   test_an_untrustworthy_candidate_file_is_exit_2's `empty` case, since
#   merging the two would let a failed or empty model call pass as a
#   reviewed set. `publish` runs downstream of `validate` unconditionally
#   and stays paired with it rather than split across runner classes.
# - issue-summary.yml's `summarize`, issue-triage.yml's `triage`,
#   ai-review-human-override.yml's `record`, and
#   disposition-deferral-check.yml's `validate-deferral`: each fires on
#   `issues`/`issue_comment`, an event any GitHub user can trigger
#   regardless of push access. The fork-vs-same-repo boolean this PR's
#   routing expression checks has no PR head repository to compare against
#   on these events, so it always evaluates "same-repo" and requests the
#   fleet -- which the AWS-side webhook's actor allowlist then rejects for a
#   non-collaborator triggering user, leaving the job queued rather than
#   running on ubuntu-latest.
# - nightly.yml's `version`: fires only on `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch`,
#   neither of which has a `github.event.pull_request` to compare against,
#   so the routing expression's fork term is always false and it always
#   requests the fleet -- the identical availability-bug mechanism as the
#   four `issues`/`issue_comment` exceptions above.
