"""Pin every inline fleet route and resolver consumer to its event policy.

Actor admission here is an availability decision: an unlisted actor or missing
repository variable gets a hosted runner, not a queued job the webhook rejects.
AWS webhook filtering remains the security boundary. Fast Gate computes this
inline because its gates must not depend on another job, and the only condition
they carry is the merge-queue push skip pinned below.
