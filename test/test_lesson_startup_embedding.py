"""Startup lessons rank with the vector the activity block already computed.

On a V1 session whose activity block embeds the first message, the prompt
builder reuses that vector (``startup_lesson_query``, served from the shared
embed cache) for every render of the lessons block. These cases pin that the
vector reaches the ranking, that a render repeated to fit the protected ceiling
does not embed again, that every row is scored on one weighted scale once there
is a vector, that every row takes the same keyword half (the rarity-weighted
overlap, on a scale fixed by the number of rows ranked) with its cosine clamped
at 0 as the vector term, so a row the vector
says nothing about (no comparable stored vector, or a cosine at or below 0)
is not measured against the best row in the set, a positive cosine only raises
a row within one ranking, the rows a vector cannot rank keep the order they
have with no vector, explicit recall on a fully embedded store separates rows
the overlap count ties, the keyword half is scaled so one rare word in a longer
row is a fraction of it at any store size, the keyword half stays bounded so a
row saturating it cannot outrank a row the vector favours more, rows tied ON
that bound are ordered by word rarity rather than recency, and a store in which
no row has a positive cosine ranks exactly as
no vector does, and that every way the vector can be missing or stale
ranks lexically instead of failing the build, a missing embedder is never
loaded from its factory, and a session that excludes the memory group keeps its
lessons and embeds nothing. ``test_memory_v1_golden`` pins the inference count and
that ``inject_activity: false`` still embeds nothing.

        With N rows ranked, a word one row carries weighs w1 = ln((N + 1) /
        1.5). ``single`` is four words long and shares only ``quartz`` with
        the request, carried by no other row, so its keyword half is
        (w1 / sqrt 4) / w1 = 0.5 at every store size and it scores
        0.4 x 0.5 = 0.2 with no vector of its own. ``favoured`` shares no word
        with the request and scores 0.6 x 0.5 = 0.3 on its cosine alone, so it
        leads at both sizes.

        Fails if the overlap is not divided by w1 (``single_row_weight =
        1.0``): its unscaled value is w1 / 2, which is 1.32 at 20 rows and 1.99
        at 80, so the cap turns it into a full half, the one-word match scores
        0.4 and overtakes the row at cosine 0.5. At 80 rows it also fails for
        a fixed divisor tuned to a small store: 2.0 puts the half at 0.997.
