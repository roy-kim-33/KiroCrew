"""Pins the auto-compaction threshold default and the relationships that make
it safe to change.

The defect this guards against is narrow and was live: ``autocompact_pct``
shipped defaulting to 90.0 while 90.0 was also the maximum its own validator
would accept, so the shipped default was the most expensive value an operator
could have chosen.

Three things are pinned, because the number alone is not the invariant:

- the value reached by the path a real install takes, which is ``load()``
  reading a config file, NOT ``SessionConfig()``;
- that the default stays strictly inside its validated range, which is the
  actual defect class;
- that the warning arm fires strictly before the compaction arm, since the two
  are consecutive arms of one if/elif chain and an equal warn level makes the
  warning unreachable.
