"""The `platformdirs` pytest11 block, pinned from outside setup.cfg.

`platformdirs` declares a `pytest11` entry point (`platformdirs_isolated`), so
pytest imports `platformdirs.pytest_plugin` during startup for every invocation
in this repository. A `pytest11` entry point that fails to import is fatal
before collection: the run exits 1 with zero tests and an annotation that says
only `exit code 1`. `setup.cfg` refuses the plugin with `-p no:platformdirs`,
which pluggy honors BEFORE it imports the module.

The block is only safe while nothing here wants the fixture, and it is only
load-bearing while it is actually in `addopts`. Both halves are asserted here,
because neither is visible from any test that merely runs under pytest -- a
commit that drops the line leaves every local run green on whatever
`platformdirs` version the developer happens to have installed, and the loss
surfaces only as a CI lane dying before collection.
