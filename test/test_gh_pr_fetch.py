"""The gh-pr FETCHER: transport, completeness, and what it hands the judge.

The module under test makes no wake decision, so nothing here asserts one. What
it must get right is a reading that is either whole or says it is not, which is
what these tests pin:

- every gh call bounded, audited, retried, and host-pinned;
- a rate-limited window backed off from rather than hammered;
- check runs paginated against the API's own ``total_count``, so a page that
  returns fewer rows than the count declares is caught;
- a failed page reported as ``partial`` rather than silently short;
- comment and review bodies carried, clipped per item and in total, with the
  bot's own comments skipped;
- a message that can never be valid refused permanently, because that is a watch
  to remove rather than a tick to retry.

The seam throughout is ``run_gh``, the single chokepoint every spawn in the
module goes through. Faking above it would leave a real subprocess in the path.
