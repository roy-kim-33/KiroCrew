"""A silent cron that sent via ``send_message`` must not read as a dead run.

A silent job is told to reply with nothing and deliver through ``send_message``,
so its turn ends with empty prose by design -- the same shape as a turn that
died before its first tool call. The gate tally counts approved tool calls and
sees each tool's title; these tests pin that the empty-reply text reads from it,
so a run that attempted a ``send_message`` delivery, a run that ran tools without
one, and a run that approved no tool each render distinctly, and only the last
reads ``_No response._``.
