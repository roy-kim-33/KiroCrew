"""Cross-session ownership of the ``settings.local.json`` seed, and the model
resolution that depends on it.

Three defects compounded into one user-visible symptom -- a claude session pinned
to the 200K window even when the account is served a 1M one -- and they only make
sense together:

1. The seed's ``availableModels`` fell back to the hand-maintained static model
   registry when the advertised-model cache was cold. The adapter merges
   ``availableModels`` union+dedup, so a registry list that has not caught up
   REPLACES the adapter's correct provider-derived list with one carrying no
   ``[1m]`` id for the model actually picked.
2. The seed ran before ``session/new`` (it must: ``permissions`` has to be on disk
   first) and nothing re-seeded after the capture that warms the cache. So the
   cold-cache seed was the FINAL state of the file, and the startup ``set_model``
   folded against a cache that was still cold.
3. Ownership was proven from per-instance memory only, so the file left behind by
   session 1 read as a stranger's file to session 2 -- which meant the
   leave-it-alone branch, forever. Nothing could repair a work_dir once seeded.

Defect 3 is why the first two could not be fixed on their own: without a
cross-session ownership credential, no later session is ever allowed to write.
The credential is provenance, not permission -- a record of the bytes Crew wrote,
where adoption additionally requires the file to still hash to them.
