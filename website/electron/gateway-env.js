/**
 * Decide where a packaged gateway's bytecode may go — and on macOS, that it may
 * not be written at all.
 *
 * Both desktop bundles ship hash-based pycs beside their sources, so a
 * packaged runtime finds its modules already compiled and has no reason to write
 * one. That is what lets this consume adjacent `__pycache__` instead of
 * redirecting to a per-user cache the first launch would have to populate.
 * macOS compiles the WHOLE tree as CHECKED-hash
 * (`compileall --invalidation-mode checked-hash` in
 * `packaging/build-desktop.sh`); Windows ships the narrower traced startup
 * closure as UNCHECKED-hash, which is enough there because a later write is
 * harmless. Both ignore mtime, which is the property that survives extraction
 * restamping; they differ only in whether the loader re-reads and re-hashes the
 * `.py` on every import, which on Windows measured a median 12.5 s per cold boot
 * across the closure's 1639 modules.
 *
 * macOS additionally FORBIDS the write. `codesign` seals every file under a
 * `.app`'s `Contents/`, so bytecode written there after signing invalidates the
 * signature and Gatekeeper refuses the app as "damaged" — reported on managed
 * Macs, whose policy re-evaluates instead of reusing a cached accept verdict.
 * Redirecting the cache elsewhere would also prevent that, but at a real price:
 * a set prefix makes CPython ignore the adjacent caches entirely, so the shipped
 * caches become dead weight and every version's first launch recompiles them
 * (measured 3.95s cold vs 0.84s warm). Forbidding the write keeps the shipped
 * caches readable — `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` disables writing only — so a
 * module inside the closure loads from disk and one outside it compiles in
 * memory and leaves no file behind.
 *
 * Windows is not locked down, deliberately: Authenticode does not seal resource
 * trees, so a write there is harmless, and letting modules outside the traced
 * closure cache themselves helps later launches. A per-machine install may be
 * read-only to the user; Python still consumes the shipped caches either way.
 *
 * Unpackaged and Linux keep the redirect: a dev tree has no shipped closure, and
 * a Linux package may be read-only with no signature to protect.

/**
 * Point the gateway at the kiro-cli copy staged into the app's own resources.
 *
 * `packaging/build-desktop.sh` (BUNDLE_KIRO_CLI) stages a pinned, sha256-verified
 * entry under `<resources>/backend-dist/kiro-cli/`: `kiro-cli-chat` on POSIX,
 * or the one `kiro-cli.exe` extracted from the Windows MSI. The backend reads
 * the directory from `KIROCREW_BUNDLED_KIRO_DIR` and ranks it above every
 * system install but below the `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` operator override
 * (`kiro_cli.known_kiro_cli_dirs`), so the app runs the exact agent runtime it
 * was built against while an operator can still force a different binary.
 *
 * Both variables are set ONLY when the directory actually shipped AND its entry
 * answers `--version` on THIS machine. A build without the payload
 * (`BUNDLE_KIRO_CLI=0` or a source checkout with no resources) spreads nothing,
 * and so does a copy that is present but does not run here (a glibc older than
 * the binary's floor, a quarantine flag, a truncated payload): discovery then
 * falls through to the user's own install exactly as an unbundled build does,
 * and the reason is logged, instead of every session failing on a binary the
 * user never chose. The gateway resolver ranks the bundled directory first
 * without probing it, so this is the one place the fall-through can happen. A
 * directory rather than a binary path because the backend owns the entry
 * name; this side spells it only for the probe.
 *
 * `KIRO_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` rides along, set here ONCE for the whole gateway
 * process tree. Every child that runs the bundled copy -- ACP sessions, the
 * `/api/models` listing, `whoami`, the usage scrape, `kirocrew doctor`, the
 * readiness probes -- inherits it by construction, instead of each spawn site
 * remembering to merge it. It is kiro-cli's documented switch for its startup
 * update check (upstream's auto-update guide: "Set to any value to disable
 * auto-update entirely"). Today that check is compiled for Windows (the
 * upstream chat-cli crate's `cli/mod.rs` at v2.24.0 gates the whole block on
 * `target_os = "windows"`; macOS and Linux never start it), so the switch stops
 * the bundled Windows executable from rewriting itself. It is also a
 * guard against upstream's stated "FUTURE: re-enable for all platforms", which
 * would otherwise write into the signed, sealed app bundle. Accepted side
 * effect: a system kiro-cli an operator forces through `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` also
 * skips the check WHILE RUNNING AS A CHILD OF THE APP; its own terminal use is
 * unaffected, and the user's `app.disableAutoupdates` setting is never written.
