 * bound, so the set of those files IS the evidence of which listeners on this
 * port are this gateway's. The rule:
 *
 *   every family the dialed host can reach must be covered by an entry.
 *
 * For a literal host that is one family, which is the old behaviour. For an
 * ambiguous name it is both, and that is what makes the name safe to dial: if
 * the gateway holds v4 and v6 on this port, then whichever one the resolver
 * picks, the party reached is the gateway that published the credential. A
 * co-resident cannot be on either, because the gateway is.
 *
 * A single missing family is a refusal, not a narrowing. If the gateway bound
 * only v4 and something else holds `[::1]:<port>`, dialing `localhost` may reach
 * that squatter, so no secret goes out at all and the caller falls through to the
 * remote-token path and then the token prompt. That is the same fail-closed cost
 * a v6-bound gateway already pays, and it is paid by refusing rather than by
 * guessing which listener answered.

/**
 * A dashboard token minted against the gateway that owns the dialed listener.
 *
 * The credential sent is the one that gateway published for its own listener,
 * identified by the address AND the port that were dialed. Neither the home-wide
 * `.local_secret` nor a port-keyed entry is a second place to look. The shared
 * file holds one slot per data home on a last-writer-wins basis, and a port-keyed
 * entry names every listener sharing that port number, so either can hold a
 * credential belonging to a gateway this call never reached. Sending that to
 * whoever answers here would surrender a credential which authenticates
 * elsewhere. An entry keyed by the dialed listener cannot escalate, because the
 * only listener it authenticates against is the one it was just sent to.
 *
 * An absent entry therefore denies rather than widens. A port no local gateway
 * bound on this address, an `ssh -L` forward's local end among them, whether or
 * not a v6-bound gateway holds the same port number, has no credential to read,
 * so the caller falls through to the remote-token path and then to the token
 * prompt.
 *
 * A REFUSED entry is not the end of the walk either. `clear_marker` runs only on
 * a graceful shutdown, so a crashed gateway leaves its entry behind, and a stale
 * exact-address entry sitting beside the live wildcard one would otherwise spend
 * the single attempt and report no token while a working credential was never
 * tried. Continuing costs nothing that matters: a dead generation's secret
 * authenticates against no listener at all, and every candidate names a listener
 * on the address being dialed, so the walk never reaches a party this call did
 * not reach.
 *
 * The token comes back ALONE, and every request that carries it keeps naming the
 * configured backend URL. The token is a bearer -- whoever receives it holds
 * dashboard authority until it expires -- and the host that URL spells may be
 * `localhost`, which names both loopback families, so something has to decide
 * that the name reaches nobody else. That decision is the coverage test above,
 * taken BEFORE the secret leaves: no token is minted unless this gateway holds
 * every family the dialed host resolves to. A second spelling to address would
 * not add to it and would cost something real -- the shell's renderer keys its
 * storage on the origin, so handing callers a rewritten one splits the settings
 * of every window addressed with it away from the dashboard's own.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<string>} the minted token, or `""` for a miss and for every
 *   refusal alike, so a caller treats an absent credential as one case.
