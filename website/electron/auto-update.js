/**
 * Desktop auto-update via electron-updater (macOS + Linux).
 *
 * WHY electron-updater instead of Electron's built-in autoUpdater: the built-in
 * updater covers only macOS (Squirrel.Mac) and Windows (Squirrel.Windows), and
 * requires us to hand-build the feed, the version compare and the publish
 * metadata. electron-updater generates that metadata at build time
 * (latest-mac.yml / latest-linux.yml), verifies sha512 fail-closed, adds Linux
 * support, and — on macOS — still drives Squirrel.Mac underneath, so the proven
 * atomic bundle swap is unchanged. See docs/guides/windows-install.md and issue #598.
 *
 * The ONE KiroCrew-specific concern vs. a plain Electron app is unchanged: the
 * bundled Python gateway is a long-running child process, so it MUST be stopped
 * gracefully BEFORE the app bundle is swapped — otherwise the swap races a live
 * child and can leave a half-replaced app. That is why autoInstallOnAppQuit is
 * forced OFF (see configureUpdater) and every install path goes through
 * stopGateway() first.
 *
 * Pure helpers (buildFeedBase) are dependency-free and tested directly.
 * initAutoUpdate takes the electron + electron-updater surfaces injected so
 * it stays testable without an Electron runtime.

// pointer/bytes host split: `new URL(fileUrl, base)` ignores the base when

/**
 * Apply the update-policy flags this app REQUIRES. Every one of these differs
 * from the electron-updater default, and each maps to a decision we already
 * made deliberately — so they are set in one audited place rather than
 * scattered:
 *
 * - autoDownload=false        consent-first UX: discovery must never download.
 *                             The default (true) would download megabytes on a
 *                             background check with no user action.
 * - autoInstallOnAppQuit=false FALSE ON EVERY PLATFORM, for two different
 *                             reasons -- electron-updater gives this one flag
 *                             two unrelated meanings:
 *
 *                             • Linux/Windows (AppImageUpdater/NsisUpdater
 *                               extend BaseUpdater): it means what the name
 *                               says. BaseUpdater.addQuitHandler() installs on
 *                               quit WITHOUT stopping the Python gateway.
 *                               deferredInstallOnQuit() does it in order.
 *
 *                             • macOS (MacUpdater extends AppUpdater, NOT
 *                               BaseUpdater, so electron-updater registers no
 *                               quit handler at all): it decides WHEN Squirrel
 *                               is handed the zip. That is NOT merely a latency
 *                               choice, because Squirrel.Mac arms the installer
 *                               at STAGE time, not at install time:
 *                               SQRLUpdater's prepareUpdateForInstallation
 *                               writes ShipItState.plist and LAUNCHES ShipIt,
 *                               a launchd job that waits on our pid and swaps
 *                               the bundle as soon as we die -- by any exit,
 *                               including a crash, Force Quit or logout.
 *                               Electron documents the consequence: "a
 *                               successfully downloaded update will always be
 *                               applied the next time the application starts."
 *                               quitAndInstall() only flips
 *                               launchAfterInstallation and terminates.
 *
 *                               Keeping this false is therefore what makes the
 *                               gateway-before-swap ordering SELF-ENFORCING:
 *                               Squirrel cannot swap because it does not have
 *                               the bytes until quitAndInstall(), which is only
 *                               reachable after an awaited stopGateway(). There
 *                               is no API to un-arm ShipIt once armed, so
 *                               eager staging would also defeat retraction --
 *                               a withdrawn build would still install on quit.
 *
 *                               Cost of this choice: the ~350MB loopback pull
 *                               happens inside quitAndInstall(), so the handoff
 *                               is slow. forceExitFailsafe() is gated on
 *                               before-quit-for-update precisely because of
 *                               that. Making staging eager safely needs an
 *                               "armed" flag that is never cleared plus an
 *                               awaited stopGateway() on EVERY quit path.
 *
 * - allowDowngrade=true       our update gate is DIFFERENCE-based, not
 *                             greater-than: a feed repointed to an older
 *                             version must be offered. This is what makes
 *                             channel switch-back and version RETRACTION work.
 * - allowPrerelease=true      every nightly (-nightly.<stamp>) and insider
 *                             (-insider.N) stamp is a semver prerelease and
 *                             would otherwise be invisible to its own channel.

  // left on disk, ShipIt is never armed, and the user relaunches into the OLD
  // version with no error shown. Observed in the field on
  // 0.1.2-nightly.20260729t073648.

  // The pre-migration client was safe with the same 5s constant because it drove
