The fixtures are the payload the capture harness renders, and the harness claims
they are the handler's verbatim output. That claim only stays true if they are
regenerated whenever the response shape changes -- otherwise they carry fields the
handler no longer emits and a reader trusting them sees a shape that cannot occur.
