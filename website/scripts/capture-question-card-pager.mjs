/**
 * Screenshot harness for the question card's pager.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared `serveDist` loopback
 * server, with every /api/** call answered by the shared `stubDashboardApi` and
 * the /api/ws websocket answered by Playwright from fixtures. No gateway, no
 * token, no worktrees. The client code under test is unmodified -- only the
 * network is stubbed -- and the card is driven the way the backend drives it, by
 * pushing a `question_card` frame into the live websocket after the page has
 * rendered.
 *
 * Replaces capture-question-card-compact.mjs, which drove the card through
 * "Collapse all" / "Expand all". Those controls are gone: a stacked card needed
 * three mechanisms to stay usable (fold all but the first, auto-fold on answer,
 * a viewport cap for whatever was still open) and the pager retires all three,
 * because one question on screen is bounded by construction.
 *
 *   01  a fresh card: question 1 of 3, Next held shut until it is answered
 *   02  answering a single-select auto-advances -- one gesture per question
 *   03  a multi-select, which does NOT auto-advance, so Next carries it forward
 *   04  the last question, where Submit replaces Next
 *   05  Submit locked with a question outstanding, naming it and offering the jump
 *   06  a single question: Submit alone, no pager to show
 *   07  after Submit: the answers as the agent receives them, each under its own
 *       question -- the format this change exists to fix
 *
 * Then records the walk as webm, plus a 2x-slowed GIF when ffmpeg is present,
 * since the page transition is motion a still cannot show. Rebuild dist first or
 * it records the previous behaviour.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-question-card-pager.mjs [outDir]
