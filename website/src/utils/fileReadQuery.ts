/**
 * The ONE `/api/file-read` fetch for a side-panel tab, and the cache key it
 * lives under.
 *
 * Three callers read a file into a tab: `usePanelDocumentActions.openFile`
 * (chip / tree click), `ChatPage`'s cold-tab hydration (after a reload), and
 * `MarkdownPanel`'s own disk refresh (Refresh, Cancel, the file watch). The
 * first two share the `['file-read', path]` React Query entry, so they must
 * store one shape; and all three must carry the backend's binary verdict with
 * the text, because the verdict decides whether the panel offers an editor at
 * all. It is read from the `X-File-Binary` header, not from the body: a `.json`
 * TEXT file is served as `application/json` too, so the content type cannot
 * tell the two apart.
