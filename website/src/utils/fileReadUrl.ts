 * them `resolve=1` mislabels them. The backend currently passes drive and UNC
 * shapes through its resolver untouched, so the flag is inert today — but the
 * classification is what the caller is asserting, so it should be true.
 *
 * Exported because it is also a SECURITY predicate: `resolve=1` resolves a
 * relative path against the gateway's CURRENT project directory at request
 * time, not against whatever project the path was recorded under. A caller
 * showing a stored path from another context (e.g. the session-doc preview)
 * must refuse a relative path outright rather than send it with `resolve=1`,
 * or a project switch turns the read into a same-named file in the newly
 * active project — silent cross-project disclosure.
 *
 * Tilde forms are split, not blanket-accepted: `~` and `~/...` expand
 * deterministically to the gateway user's OWN home (project-independent, so
 * absolute in the sense this predicate asserts), but `~name/...` expands only
 * if `name` is a real account — the backend's `expanduser` leaves an unknown
 * `~name` UNCHANGED and its resolver then anchors it to the process CWD,
 * which re-opens the exact cross-project disclosure above. `~name` (and the
 * POSIX-ambiguous `~\`) are therefore classified NOT absolute: the preview
 * refuses them, and resolve=1 callers get the backend's project-dir
 * resolution, which is bounded (it errors on escape) rather than CWD-anchored.
 * This mirrors the backend materialize allowlist, which trusts only paths
 * that are absolute AFTER expansion. */

 * The failure copy lives HERE, not in each caller: both passed the identical

 * every other failure by the endpoint's machine-readable `code` field
 * (`content_redacted`, the same discriminator its file-stream and upload
 * siblings emit) -- NOT by the bare 400, which the endpoint also returns for an
 * invalid or out-of-project path. So a flagged file reads "blocked by the
 * credential scan" while a rejected path reads the generic "Download failed"
 * the user may retry. Either way the refusal is surfaced through `onError`,
 * never defeated -- the bytes are not reached another way.
