/**
 * Resolve the extra steering directories for a folder.
 *
 * Unlike `resolveFolderProjectDir` (nearest-wins), steering dirs ACCUMULATE up
 * the parent_id chain: an org-standards folder above a per-repo folder must
 * contribute both sets. The result is ordered ROOT-FIRST — the outermost
 * ancestor's dirs precede the folder's own — and de-duplicated, keeping the
 * FIRST occurrence so the root-most contribution wins its position.
 *
 * Cycle-guarded like `nearestFolderValue`: a corrupt `parent_id` chain (a
 * folder revisited on the way up, or a parent that no longer exists) ends the
 * walk rather than spinning.
 *
 * PRINCIPAL-FILTERED like the backend delivery gate: a level owned by another
 * principal (a non-empty `owner_app` that differs from `principal`) is skipped,
 * because the backend never delivers that ancestor's directories to a chat
 * running as `principal`. Listing them here would present inert steering as
 * inherited. The person's folders carry no `owner_app` and are in effect for
 * every principal, matching the backend rule exactly (`owner && owner !==
 * principal`). `principal` is the owner of the folder being resolved — the
 * empty string for a person-owned folder.
