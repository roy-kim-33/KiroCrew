/**
 * Does the composer hold work the user has not sent yet?
 *
 * ONE definition for every caller, because the answer gates a
 * DESTRUCTIVE action: the `close` option action tears its tab down, and the
 * composer is the only copy of whatever is staged in it. No production caller
 * exists yet — this lands ahead of its wiring. The INTENDED call sites, which
 * arrive with the later PRs of stack #6823, consult it at two moments —
 *
 *  - `ChatInput` is to ask at RENDER time, to decide whether the action chip is
 *    even clickable; and
 *  - the shared close dispatcher is to ask again immediately BEFORE closing,
 *    because the dispatch awaits a network write and a draft typed inside that
 *    window is invisible to the render-time gate. Nothing else moves in that
 *    window: typing appends no transcript row, so the source-key staleness check
 *    cannot see it.
 *
 * ## Why every field is REQUIRED
 *
 * This was variadic (`...attachments: (unknown[] | boolean | undefined)[]`), and
 * that shape let a host omit a whole category of staged work with no type error —
 * on the argument list of a destructive gate. It happened twice: the first
 * version counted text and files only, and a KNOWLEDGE selection (which leaves no
 * token, so every text-derived term reads false) sailed through both seams; and
 * the two hosts drifted to 2-arg and 5-arg calls of the same predicate without a
 * word from the compiler.
 *
 * Named REQUIRED fields make both impossible. A host that genuinely cannot stage
 * a category has to say so — `knowledge: false` is a claim someone made, where a
 * missing argument was only ever an absence nobody noticed. Adding a category
 * later breaks every PRODUCTION call site on purpose, which is the point: each
 * host must then answer for it. Until the wiring lands there are none to break.
 *
 * That guarantee stops at the project boundary, and the gap is worth knowing:
 * `tsconfig.app.json` excludes `src/test` and every `*.test.ts(x)`, so a TEST
 * fixture that omits a field compiles anyway and the missing term reads
 * `undefined` — falsy, i.e. the old behaviour, asserted green. So a fixture here
 * is not protected by the type and has to be updated by hand when a category is
 * added; the field list below is the checklist for that.

   * unsent work with no trace in any collection above. It is the worst of the

   * `sessionOwner` only after the server handshake resolves, so for the length of
   * that handshake real audio exists while the gated flag still reads false —
   * exactly the cold window this finding names. The mic is one shared device, so

   * chip for a moment is the right side of that trade against losing speech.
