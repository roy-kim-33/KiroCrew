/**
 * The shared instant-tooltip spelling for the follow-up chips and ChatInput's
 * `ResizeBadge`. `PastePreviewTooltip` records why this repo shares tooltip
 * renderers ("so the two previews cannot drift"); this module is the same rule
 * applied to the hover bubble those two call sites need. The chrome, the
 * positioning and the show/hide gesture live here once; a call site owns only
 * its content and a width/wrap variant class. (`ContextBreakdownPanel` still
 * hand-rolls a sibling hover tip; migrating it is deferred, tracked on
 * PR #9552's review thread.)
 *
 * Semantics, chosen against the native `title` this replaces:
 * - Pointer shows after a short intent delay (`OPEN_DELAY_MS`, 100ms) — long
 *   enough that a pointer merely crossing the element on its way somewhere
 *   else paints nothing, short enough to still read as instant. The ~1s OS
 *   delay was the defect; zero was the flicker.
 * - Keyboard focus shows synchronously. A tab stop is deliberate in a way a
 *   pointer transit is not, and a keyboard user has no second cursor to wave.
 * - Escape hides while open, without requiring blur.
 * - A touch tap never shows the hint (`TOUCH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS`): the mouse
 *   events a browser replays for a tap are ignored, decided by the tap's own
 *   pointer events so a real mouse on a touch device still hovers. On iOS a
 *   hint appearing mid-tap cost the click. A held outcome still opens, and an
 *   anchor may opt in (`openOnTap`) when its bubble outranks its click.
 * - A scroll that can move the anchor hides while open: the position is
 *   captured at show time, so after such a scroll the bubble would sit
 *   detached from its anchor. Capture phase, because the strips that scroll
 *   (`overflow-x-auto`) do not bubble their scroll events to window. A scroll
 *   anywhere else in the document leaves the anchor where it was, so the
 *   bubble stays (see `scrollMovesAnchor`).
 * - A consumer may HOLD the bubble (`useInstantTip({ hold })`) while it carries
 *   an outcome rather than a hint — the copy chip's "Copied!" / "Copy failed"
 *   flash. While held, a mouse leave does not close it (a mouse user moves on
 *   right after clicking, and the bubble is the only visible confirmation),
 *   and a hold that begins with the bubble closed opens it at the last anchor
 *   (a click inside the intent window, or after the pointer already left,
 *   still owes its outcome). When the hold ends the bubble closes unless the
 *   pointer or focus is still on the anchor. Blur, Escape and an anchor-moving
 *   scroll close it regardless: a tab stop moved on deliberately, and a stale
 *   position is worse than a missed confirmation. One bubble at a time across
 *   anchors, held ones ranking above hints: a neighbour's hint arriving
 *   mid-flash yields and returns when the hold ends, a new outcome supersedes.
 * - In running text (`placement: 'flow'`, the message chips) the bubble opens
 *   above from the first line of its flow container (`FLOW_CONTAINER`) and below
 *   from any lower line while it fits inside that container, so it never covers the words that lead up to
 *   the anchor (`flowPlacement`). A held outcome re-anchors the bubble, so the
 *   viewport clamp is re-measured for the new content.
