 * is created exactly once, here, so a provider and the component reading it can
 * never hold two different objects. The other four carry the renderer root's
 * (and `MdAnchor`'s) state down to overrides that react-markdown instantiates
 * deep inside its own tree, where no prop can reach. The one context kept out of
 * this module, `MediaApprovedCtx`, is private to `remoteMedia.tsx`: its provider

 * URL in one document as one resource. The second `<img>` is then served from the
 * in-document memory cache with no network request at all, so the new message
 * paints the OLD bytes. Measured in Chrome: without a distinct URL the edited
 * file is never re-fetched, and no HTTP cache header changes that — `ETag`,
 * `Cache-Control: no-cache` and even `no-store` are not consulted, because the
 * request is never made.
 *
 * Making the URL per-message gives each impression its own cache entry, so a new

 * Stable within a message, so re-renders and streaming do not re-request.
