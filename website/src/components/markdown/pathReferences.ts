 * all four, so a path cannot classify one way as a chip and another as a link.

/**
 * Character-level shape of a local filesystem path: letters and digits in any
 * script (`\p{L}\p{N}` — filenames are not ASCII-only), combining marks
 * (`\p{M}` — macOS stores NFD-decomposed forms, and Indic/Thai/Arabic scripts
 * need marks even under NFC), underscore, dot, dash, @, ~, colon, space and
 * PARENTHESES, separated by slashes — EITHER kind, because a Windows gateway
 * names its files with `\`. Anchored at both ends, so anything carrying a URL
 * scheme (`https://…`) or shell punctuation fails outright.
 *
 * The punctuation set is a DECIDED boundary, not an accumulation. Two review
 * rounds each found one more character that is legal in a real filename —
 * parentheses (`C:\Program Files (x86)`, the most-trodden directory on Windows)
 * and then an apostrophe (`C:\Users\O'Neil`) — which is the signature of an
 * allowlist being discovered one bug report at a time. So the rule is stated once
 * instead: admit every character that is legal in a filename on BOTH platforms
 * and is not a shell control operator, on both shapes, since the two describe one
 * filesystem convention and an asymmetry is only a later bug report.
 *
 * IN: letters, marks, digits, `_ . @ ~ - space` and `' ! # % = + , ( ) [ ] { }`.
 * A closing bracket may also END a path, so `App (old)` and `data [2026]`
 * classify as directories.
 *
 * OUT, deliberately — these are what keep the anchored shape from matching a
 * command or a URL: `$` and a backtick (expansion), `&` `;` `|` (chaining),
 * `<` `>` (redirection), `"` (quoting), `?` `*` (globbing), and `:` anywhere but
 * the last segment, where it serves `file:447`. Windows forbids `< > : " / \ | ?
 * *` in a filename outright, so excluding them costs nothing there and buys the
 * prose rejection everywhere.
 *
 * Widening the repertoire never widens the positive-signal rule, so punctuated
 * prose (`foo/bar (baz)`, `a&&b/c.sh`) still carries neither a root nor an
 * extension and is still refused below.
 *
 * Admitting `\` as a separator here is what lets a relative Windows path
 * (`src\main.py`, `.\src\main.py`) reach the probe. It cannot express a
 * DRIVE-rooted path, whose colon sits before the first separator while this
 * shape allows a colon only in the last segment (where it serves `file:447`),
 * so that form has its own shape below.
 *
 * Shape alone is NOT sufficient to linkify — see `isPathCandidate`.

 * NOT an oversight that the Windows support here stops at drive letters. A UNC

 * attacker-authored (a rendered web page, a quoted file, any untrusted text a
 * message carries), so admitting one would let that text make the dashboard ask
 * the gateway to stat `\\attacker.example\share\x`. On Windows that stat is an
 * outbound SMB connection, which offers the host's NTLM credentials — a
 * credential-leak vector, from nothing but rendering a message.
 *
 * Windows reads ANY two leading separators as a UNC root, of either kind and in
 * either order, so the character class is the whole point: matching two of the
 * SAME kind (`\\\\` or `//`) leaves `\\/attacker.example\\share\\x` and its `/\\`
 * mirror admitted, and those resolve to the same share. A mixed pair is the same
 * vector under a different coat of paint, and unlike the `//` spelling it is a
 * shape no pre-diff predicate here could even form.
 *
 * Three places in this codebase already hold exactly this line, and this is the

 * `src` values, `MdAnchor` refuses a decoded `//`-prefixed link destination, and
 * `WIN_PRODUCER_PATH_RE` (utils/fileTokens.ts) documents the producer/consumer
 * asymmetry that makes all of them deliberate — our own upload endpoint may emit
 * a UNC path because we trust it, while every consumer-side predicate over
 * authorable text must refuse the host-naming shape.
 *
 * Cost on POSIX is nil: `//tmp/x` names the same file as `/tmp/x`, which is
 * still a candidate. Cost on Windows is that a network-share path renders as a
 * copy chip rather than an open chip — the same trade `MdAnchor` already makes.

 * Deliberately a PRE-FILTER, not a decision. "Is `refs/heads/fix/foo` a path?"
 * is not a syntactic question — it is a filesystem question — so this only
 * decides whether spending a stat probe is worthwhile. The probe
 * (`usePathKind`) makes the actual call.
 *
 * Merely containing a slash is not enough: that matched git refs
 * (`refs/heads/…`, `origin/main`), repo slugs (`owner/repo`), MIME types
 * (`text/plain`), npm scopes (`@scope/pkg`) and dates (`2026/08/02`), every one
 * of which then rendered as a clickable "file" that could only ever 404. So a
 * candidate must carry a positive signal that it names a location:
 *
 *   - rooted — POSIX (`/x`, `~/x`) or a Windows drive (`C:\x`, `C:/x`), or
 *   - explicitly relative (`./x`, `../x`, `.\x`, `..\x`), or
 *   - a file extension on the last segment (`src/main.py`, `src\main.py`).
 *
 * A bare two-segment identifier with no extension is rejected. That rejection is
 * what keeps the backslash separator safe on every platform: a `\`-joined
 * non-path carries no extension, so an escape sequence (`\n`), a registry key
 * (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Foo`) and a domain-qualified login
 * (`CORP\alice`) all still fail here rather than becoming a chip that could only
 * 404. Note the third rule still admits `origin/feature/x.ts`; that is
 * intentional — syntax cannot settle it, and the stat probe will.
 *
 * UNC is refused FIRST, ahead of every shape and signal test, because the other
 * rules would otherwise readmit it: the extension rule matches
 * `\\host\share\x.txt`, and the leading-`/` rule matches `//host/share/x`.
 * See `UNC_PREFIX_RE` for why that shape must never reach the probe.
 *
 * A directory written with a trailing separator (`/home/user/notes/`,
 * `C:\Users\me\`) is classified by retrying on the slash-stripped form when the
 * literal string fails: `PATH_SHAPE_RE` requires the string to END in a name
 * character, so a trailing `/` otherwise fails the shape and the directory chip
 * renders dead -- the directory-chip half of issue #9409. This widens NOTHING.
 * The retry runs the SAME rules on the string minus one trailing separator, so a
 * trailing slash rescues only a string whose slash-less form is already a
 * candidate: `owner/repo/`, `text/plain/` and `2026/08/02/` stay rejected because
 * `owner/repo` etc. are. The literal form is tried first so a bare drive root
 * (`C:\`, whose slash-stripped `C:` is not a valid shape) keeps classifying, and
 * the UNC refusal runs on the ORIGINAL string so `//host/share/` cannot slip
 * through the strip.
