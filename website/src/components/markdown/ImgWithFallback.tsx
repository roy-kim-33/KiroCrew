 * after the message rendered fine for its author. The chip names that
 * condition, and the whole chip is click-to-copy for the on-disk path:
 * recovery starts from knowing WHICH file is gone, and the path is the one
 * thing the transcript still holds.
 *
 * The `<img>` error event carries no status, so "file no longer exists" is
 * NOT asserted from the error alone — a backend hiccup, a sensitive-path
 * denial (403), or a file still being written all fire the same event. A
 * cheap HEAD probe re-asks the endpoint, and only a confirmed 404 (the
 * backend's not-found refusal) earns the missing-file wording; every other
 * outcome — including a failed probe — keeps the generic load-failure line,
 * so the chip never states a cause it did not verify. Remote URLs are never
 * probed: a cross-origin HEAD says nothing reliable and the generic wording
 * is already honest there.
