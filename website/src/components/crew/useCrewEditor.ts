/**
 * useCrewEditor — the whole EDIT-mode brain of the crew editor, extracted from
 * `KiroCrewAgentsPage` so more than one surface can open it.
 *
 * The crew editor was born inside the Crews page and reached from elsewhere by
 * navigating to `/capabilities?tab=crews&crew=<name>`. CREW-18688 asks the
 * Crewmates page to edit a bot WITHOUT leaving the page — a modal on the bot
 * page. The invariant-dense logic that makes editing correct (the stale-write
 * epoch guard, the serialized template-switch chain, avatar staging, the
 * discard question) must not be re-implemented per surface, so it lives here
 * once and `CrewEditorDialog` renders it. Today the ONLY consumer is
 * `MembersPage` (the in-place Crewmates modal); folding `KiroCrewAgentsPage`'s
 * own inline edit sheet onto this hook/dialog is the committed follow-up, after
 * which both surfaces share this one state machine.
 *
 * This hook owns EDIT only. Creating a crew stays in `KiroCrewAgentsPage`'s own
 * form: the two share field COMPONENTS, not this state machine, and a create
 * wizard is a separate decision (see the page's create branch).
 *
 * Every reference-carrying comment below (issue numbers, the epoch rationale,
 * the avatar tier spellings) is moved verbatim from the page — this is a
 * relocation, not a rewrite, so the pinned behaviour is preserved exactly.
