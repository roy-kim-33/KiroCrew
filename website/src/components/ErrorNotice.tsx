 * (`utils/errorReport`), so no call site has to start threading an error object.
 *
 * Pass `report` instead when the caller genuinely holds one (a caught
 * `ApiError`), which skips the message-match lookup.
 *
 * ## Two variants, because the dashboard has two shapes
 *
 * `block` is the boxed banner at the top of a panel. `inline` is the compact
 * run of text that sits inside an existing button row — those sites are laid out
 * as flex children, so dropping a bordered box into one would break the row. The
 * variant is a layout choice only; both carry the same agent hand-off.
