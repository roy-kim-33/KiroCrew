/**
 * App-root dialog stacking.
 *
 * The App shell mounts several full-screen dialogs as siblings inside its own
 * `relative z-[1]` root (App.tsx) — NOT portaled to document.body the way
 * Modal.tsx is. That means their z-index competes directly with the chat page's
 * own chrome, which deliberately paints ABOVE the chat pane: the sessions flyout
 * (`SessionFlyout.tsx`, z-[59]) and its drawer morph (z-[60]), the focus-peek
 * rail toggle (App.tsx, z-[61]), and the focus-mode top chrome / mac drag strips
 * (inline zIndex 62 / 63). A dialog overlay left on the chat-pane ceiling (z-50)
 * paints UNDER all of that — the bug #15754 fixed for MobileConnectModal and
 * #15776 fixes for the three remaining App-root dialogs.
 *
 * This test pins that contract at the SOURCE level, the same technique
 * `MobileConnectModal.test.tsx` uses: jsdom paints nothing, so the only sound
 * thing to compare is the z-index each source declares, which is the property
 * paint order follows. Two invariants per dialog overlay:
 *
 *   1. it sits ABOVE every chat-chrome layer, so it can no longer be obscured
 *      by the sessions flyout and friends; and
 *   2. it stays strictly BELOW the shell's z-[100] full-screen takeover layer
 *      (UpdateModal's "Installing update…" / install-failed surface, and
 *      App.tsx's update-error and first-run handoff overlays), which must keep
 *      covering everything — including a dialog that happens to be open —
 *      because they render in the SAME shell stacking context DOM-earlier, so a
 *      tie at z-[100] here would win on document order and paint a dismissible
 *      dialog over the surface meant to hide the app mid-update.
 *
 * Modal.tsx's own z-[100] is explicitly NOT the bar: Modal portals to
 * document.body, a separate stacking context where z-[100] is correct. These
 * dialogs do not, so the right layer for them is the band between the chat
 * chrome (max 63) and the shell takeover layer (100) — z-[65] today.
