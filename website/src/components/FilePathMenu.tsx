/**
 * Shared file-path context menu: Open in default app, Reveal in Finder / file
 * manager, Copy path. Exposed as a right-click wrapper (`FilePathMenu`); the
 * item rows themselves are a private building block (`FilePathMenuItems`).
 *
 * The two OTHER file-location surfaces (MarkdownPanel's overflow and
 * FileViewer's overflow) are custom plain-button dropdowns, not Radix
 * ContextMenus, so they cannot host Radix `ContextMenuItem`s. They dedupe by
 * reusing the shared `revealOrOpen` failure path and `useRevealLabel` platform
 * label instead of the row component — so `FilePathMenuItems` has no consumer
 * beyond this file and is deliberately NOT exported (a zero-consumer export is
 * dead surface area).
 *
 * Open/Reveal items render only when `directLocal` is true (the backend reports
 * the request comes from a browser on the same machine). Remote and tunneled
 * sessions see Copy path only, because opening Finder on a host the user is not
 * looking at is useless.
 *
 * The reveal label is platform-aware — it reuses the same gatewayPlatform-driven
 * wording MarkdownPanel's overflow menu uses, so the two menus name the identical
 * action identically ("Open in Finder" on macOS, "Open in File Explorer" on
 * Windows, "Show in file manager" otherwise) instead of drifting apart.
 *
 * "Open with default app" is hidden for directories: `/api/reveal` rejects an
 * `open` action on a directory (400), so offering it would be a guaranteed-fail
 * click. Reveal still applies — it shows the folder in the file manager.
 *
 * It is also hidden on a Windows gateway: files.py refuses the launch-by-
 * association verb there (platform_compat.open_with_default_app answers False,
 * so the backend degrades an `open` to a clipboard copy), which would make the
 * row promise a launch it can never perform. Reveal still works on Windows.

 * Perform a reveal/open and, on failure, show the SHARED i18n failure message.
 *
 * Exported so every file-location surface (this menu, MarkdownPanel's overflow,
 * FileViewer's overflow) funnels its reveal through one failure path instead of
 * each re-deriving its own `alert(err.message)` — a raw server string leaks
 * internal wording and drifts per surface.
 *
 * A `/api/reveal` denial for a sensitive path is a deliberate security decision
 * (files.py answers 403 for a path `is_sensitive_path` refuses), not a
 * malfunction. Flattening it into the generic "couldn't open" wording reads as a
 * bug and invites a retry, so a 403 that is NOT the auth-expiry 403
 * (`authRequired`, which has its own re-auth recovery) gets the blocked-by-policy
 * string instead. The branch keys off the status code carried on `ApiError`, not
 * the server's prose — the raw denial text never reaches the UI.
 *
 * Returns `{ copied, copyFailed }` so a caller that promised a reveal/open through a
 * "Show in file manager" affordance can acknowledge the silent degrade. On a
 * headless direct-local session the backend still degrades an open/reveal to a
 * clipboard copy, and without a signal the click looks like a dead no-op. The
 * copy itself is still performed HERE (so callers that ignore the return — the
 * chip's Shift+click, the overflow buttons — keep working unchanged and
 * `api.revealPath` stays side-effect-free); the flag only lets the menu flip its
 * existing "Path copied" swap. A failed reveal/open is non-routine and IS
 * surfaced regardless (below).
 *
 * `copyFailed` is separate from `!copied` because the two mean different things
 * to the caller: `copied: false, copyFailed: false` is the ordinary case where
 * the backend drove a real file manager and there was nothing to acknowledge,
 * while `copyFailed` is a degrade that then FAILED and must not be acknowledged
 * as a copy. `copyToClipboard` signals that by RETURNING false rather than
 * throwing (its `execCommand` fallback path — see utils/clipboard.ts), so the
 * boolean is the only evidence the clipboard actually changed; claiming a write
 * that did not happen is worse than saying nothing, because the user then pastes
 * whatever was there before.
