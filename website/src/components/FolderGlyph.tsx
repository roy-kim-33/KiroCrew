// Default classes carry the stroke color: the icon paints via currentColor, so

// hovered. Callers that pass className own the color instead.

/** The sidebar folder glyph: lucide's Folder/FolderOpen, tinted by the
 *  folder's palette color — stroke pulled toward text-strong for rail-icon
 *  contrast, body washed with the color over the theme surface. Only the
 *  CLOSED shape takes the wash: FolderOpen's flap overlaps its body, so any
 *  fill paints the overlap as a solid slab; the open state stays stroke-only,
 *  which also reads lighter while the folder's contents are on screen.
 *  When the folder carries an emoji `icon` (auto-generated or user-picked),
 *  the emoji replaces the lucide shape entirely; `color` keeps applying only
 *  where the default glyph renders, so the two marks never fight. The lucide
 *  shapes carry the collapse cue themselves (Folder vs FolderOpen); the emoji
 *  cannot, so collapsible callers — the ones that pass `open` at all — get a
 *  small disclosure chevron overlaid on the emoji box's bottom-right corner
 *  (the sidebar's one chevron grammar: ChevronRight, rotated 90° when open).
 *  The overlay is absolutely positioned so the glyph box keeps its exact
 *  width and the folder-alignment geometry (ChatSidebar.folderAlignment
 *  .test.tsx) is untouched. Callers that render the glyph outside a
 *  collapse context (modal preview, menus, drag ghost) omit `open` and get
 *  the bare emoji.
 *  Shared by the sidebar rows and the folder-settings modal's live preview. */
