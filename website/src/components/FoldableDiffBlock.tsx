/**
 * A prose ```diff fence, COLLAPSED to a one-line chip by default.
 *
 * A message that changes several files carries several fences, and a fully
 * expanded patch is tens of rows each — so the prose the user actually came
 * for scrolls off. The chip states the same three facts a reader needs to
 * decide whether to look (which file, how much added, how much removed) in one
 * row, and the patch is one click away.
 *
 * The chip is the fence's ONE toggle and stays mounted while the patch is open:
 * the same control that opened it closes it, reads `aria-expanded`, and shows
 * its state (filled background, trailing chevron turned up). This is the same
 * grammar as `ToolCallLine`'s tool-card chip, so the two pills — which look
 * alike and sit in the same transcript — close the same way. Both default
 * CLOSED, but each remembers its expansions in its own module-scope set,
 * because the two are keyed differently (a fence's `foldKey` vs a
 * `tool_call_id`).
 *
 * Applied ONLY where the fence is a retelling: `MarkdownRenderer` opts in with
 * `collapseDiffs`, which the chat transcript sets and no other surface does. On
 * an artifact, spec, changelog or review page the patch IS the content, and
 * hiding it there would take it out of the DOM for find-in-page, whole-page
 * selection and printing.
 */

/**
 * Fences the user has opened, keyed by `foldKey`. Module-level for the same
 * reason `ToolCallLine.openedDiffCards` is: the transcript re-mounts messages
 * (load-earlier, variant switch, tab return), and an expansion that evaporates
 * on re-mount reads as the UI closing the patch while it is being read.
 * Session-scoped by intent — a reload starts collapsed again.
