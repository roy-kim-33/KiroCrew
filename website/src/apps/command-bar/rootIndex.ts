 *
 * `attention` leads and is usually EMPTY. It holds the sessions that owe the user

 * most time-sensitive object this product has and the only kind of row a launcher
 * over a static app catalogue cannot produce. It is built from the store the
 * dashboard already keeps live, so leading with it costs the root no request.
 *
 * `recent` follows it: the handful of sessions the reader was last in. The most
 * common reason this surface is opened at all is "get me back to what I was
 * doing", and that answer is already in the same live store — so it is a row to
 * press, not a search to run. It is capped small on purpose (see the caller): a
 * switch list stops being one the moment it becomes an index, and the full corpus
 * is one `view` row below it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `folders` group: the sidebar's folders are a CORPUS, and
 * a corpus is reached here the way sessions are — one `view` row under `commands`
 * that the reader enters. Flattening the folder list into this index made the same
 * collection behave unlike every other corpus the surface holds, and cost it two
 * mechanisms (an idle demotion and a group cap) to keep tens of the user's own
