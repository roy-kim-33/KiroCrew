/**
 * SCOPE BOUNDARY: a per-endpoint deadline is for a fetch the user waits on where an
 * unsettled promise is indistinguishable from an empty result AND the surface behind it
 * names a timeout apart from a failure in its own copy. That second half is the real
 * limit: a consumer rendering the server's message verbatim would surface this
 * rejection's untranslated `deadline exceeded` in every locale, trading a spinner for a
 * worse bug -- which is why the git panel and the knowledge search stay unbounded.
 *
 * Scope is stated as the CONSTANT set, not as a share of the client's `fetch('/api/...`
 * sites: that ratio was the argument for a general bound, but any unrelated edit to the API
 * client moves it, so it cannot be a rule. Scope is the four constants below, each carrying
 * its own rationale; an interim per-endpoint bound is a legal addition while the transport
 * default is pending. The general bound belongs
 * in the shared transport and cannot be blanket -- the long-poll endpoints and the streaming
 * reader must opt out -- and when it lands these constants are RETIRED. Retirement tracked in
 * #11420. The replacement MUST
 * keep rejecting with a `TimeoutError`-named `Error`: `isDeadlineError` and `searchErrorCause`
 * key on that name, so a transport that rejects any other shape silently degrades every
 * cause-keyed notice added here back to the generic "failed" copy.
 *
 * RETRY is not uniform and that is deliberate: a listing takes one bounded attempt, since a retry
 * re-enters the bound and doubles it, while the @-menu search alone keeps the shared throttle
 * ladder so a 429 recovers instead of reading as an absence of matches.
