/**
 * Reads the execution-choice catalog (`GET /api/agents/catalog`): configured
 * members AND installed shared templates, each row tagged `selection_kind`.
 *
 * It is a READ. The hook used to POST `/api/agents/sync` once per mount before
 * listing, and that write enrolled every discovered template as a crew member
 * (config row + member memory) just so the picker could offer it. Opening a chat,
 * the schedule form or the channel page therefore grew the Crew Members roster
 * as a side effect. The catalog lists a template without making it a member, so
 * a picker no longer has to mutate the registry to show what can run.
 *
 * @param sessionKey Chat-slot key whose project scope should apply. Omit on
 *   surfaces with no slot context; project-scoped agents are then excluded.
 * @param projectDir The slot's current project directory. The server resolves
 *   project-scoped agents from it, so it is part of this fetch's identity, not
 *   just an input to it: pointing the SAME slot at a different project changes
 *   the roster without changing `sessionKey`. Omit on surfaces with no slot
 *   context (the roster is then global-only and cannot go stale this way).
 *
 * @returns `choices` — the catalog rows a namespace-aware picker (the chat agent
 *   pop-up) renders, keyed by (selection_kind, name). Unless the gateway's
 *   `dashboard.crewmates_in_agent_picker` config is `true` (read from the shared
 *   `['kirocrewConfig']` query, like `useCrewmateThreadsFlag`), a member row is
 *   withheld when a listed template reaches the same binding (see
 *   `withoutCoveredCrewmates`); a crewmate no template covers stays pickable.
 *   With the key on, every member is listed, a member and a template of one name
 *   are two rows here, and picking one sends its kind.
 * @returns `agents` — the same catalog folded to ONE row per name for the
 *   name-only consumers (the schedule form's `agent_id`, the channel and project
 *   pages, the keyboard cycle). A member wins the fold because the backend's
 *   name-first resolution answers a bare name with the alias, so the template
 *   the fold hides is exactly the one a bare name could not reach anyway.
 * @returns `error` — the catalog fetch FAILED, as distinct from an install that
 *   genuinely has one agent. The two used to be the same observation: the fetch
 *   swallowed its rejection and left `agents` empty, so every caller rendered a
 *   failed load as a legitimately short list (#5990). Callers that cannot
 *   otherwise recover must surface it and offer `reload`.
 * @returns `reload` — re-run the fetch. `refreshTrigger` cannot serve as the
 *   retry on a surface that passes a constant (the schedule form passes `0`),
 *   because the effect then never runs again for the life of the mount.
 * @returns `reloading` — a `reload` fetch is in flight. Without it a retry that
 *   fails AGAIN is invisible: `setError(true)` over an already-true value bails
 *   out of re-rendering, so the surface is pixel-identical after the click and
 *   the one recovery affordance looks broken during the very outage it exists
 *   for. Callers use it to make the attempt visibly complete.
