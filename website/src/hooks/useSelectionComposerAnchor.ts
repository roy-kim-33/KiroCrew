 * - the PENDING anchor (written only in `onOpen`, when the toolbar has just
 *   accepted THIS selection) and the STAGED bridge anchor (a selection inside
 *   an iframe body, promoted to pending only if the toolbar opens for that same
 *   text — the toolbar refuses to re-target a box holding a typed draft, so
 *   writing pending straight from the bridge would submit that draft against
 *   the passage selected AFTER it was typed);
 * - the `externalSelection` the toolbar opens the box from for iframe bodies;
 * - the stand-in highlight token (focus in the input collapses the real
 *   selection; the host's resolver paints under this owner, the wiring clears);
 * - the draft mirror (`onDraftChange`), the per-host durable draft store, and
 *   the guard the host runs before its own actions would unmount the toolbar.
 *
 * `A` is the host's anchor record: `quoteOf` reads the selected text back out
 * of it (the bridge-promotion match) and `quoteOnly` builds the fallback when
 * neither a live range nor a matching staged anchor exists.
