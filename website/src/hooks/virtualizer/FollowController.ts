// FollowController — pure decision logic for the chat "stick to bottom" follow.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ===============
// The chat scroller has to keep the latest message pinned to the bottom while
// content streams in and widget iframes load asynchronously — but it must NOT
// fight the user when they scroll up to read history. Earlier attempts encoded
// this as a tangle of refs (`pinToBottomRef` + `intentionalPinRef` +
// `lastScrollTopRef` + a two-mode distance gate) whose updates depended on the
// `scroll` event firing before a ResizeObserver callback. That ordering is not
// guaranteed: a widget that finishes loading right after the user scrolls up
// fires its RO with a stale "we're following" flag and yanks the user back to
// the bottom. Every fix to one symptom spawned another because the decision
// was spread across event handlers that race each other.
//
// THE MODEL
// =========
// A single boolean `stick` ("the viewport should stay pinned to the bottom").
//   - It is turned OFF only by a genuine user scroll away from the bottom.
//   - It is turned ON only by the user returning to the bottom, or by an
//     explicit jump-to-bottom / slot-entry (a "forced" pin).
//
// Two facts make the decision race-proof without depending on event ordering:
//
//   1. `el.scrollTop` is readable SYNCHRONOUSLY. At the moment we are about to
//      pin (inside the RO / layout-effect), we compare the live scrollTop to
//      the position we last WROTE ourselves (`lastWriteTop`). If the live value
//      is below it, the user has scrolled up since our last write — even if the
//      `scroll` event has not dispatched yet — so we release `stick` and skip
//      the pin. (`evaluateAutoPin`)
//
//   2. Our own programmatic writes also fire `scroll` events. We recognise them
//      by comparing scrollTop to `lastWriteTop` (`isSelfScroll`) so they never
//      get mistaken for the user scrolling and never flip `stick`.
//
// All functions here are pure so the behaviour is verifiable without a DOM.

  // gesture. Their arrival is theirs when they moved at least as far as the
  // growth carried them (see `readerTravel` for the derivation and a worked
  // example); a nudge the growth did most of the work for is not. A SHRINK is
