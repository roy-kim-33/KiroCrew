/**
 * One reader's verdict on one Jev answer, as a thumbs pair.
 *
 * Shared by every surface that rates a decision — the skill-selection strip under
 * an assistant reply (`DecisionStrip.tsx`), the risk badge on a tool card
 * (`ToolRiskBadge.tsx`) and the mid-turn handling line on a user row
 * (`SteerDecisionLine.tsx`) — so they cannot drift on what a press sends, what it
 * remembers, or what a failure looks like. A second copy would be a second
 * chance to post the wrong `side`, and the log's summary is keyed on that field.
 *
 * Two thumbs, and they are ONE control: the verdict is single-choice
 * (`right` | `wrong` | none), which is the case `max-two-buttons-per-row` names
 * as not counting toward its cap. Pressing the lit thumb takes the answer back,
 * so a misclick is undoable without a third control.
 *
 * `label` is VISIBLE and required, and it lives here rather than at the call
 * sites so no surface can ship without one. A bare thumb beside a line of
 * text does not say what it rates, and an `aria-label` answers that for a screen
 * reader only — `IconButton` renders no text and no tooltip of its own, so each
 * button also carries its meaning as a `title`.
 *
 * The answer is kept only after the server took it. An optimistic flip would
 * have to be rolled back on a failure, and there is an honest alternative: the
 * pair is disabled while the request is in flight, and a failure renders beside
 * it rather than silently reverting.
 *
 * The mutation is handed the SHARED query client explicitly rather than reading
 * one out of context, for the reason `app-sdk/appQuery.ts` gives: these rows are
 * drawn by `app-sdk/messageRenderers`, whose whole contract is that a host may
 * render a transcript outside the dashboard's React root.
