/**
 * Developer > Feature Previews — opt in to surfaces that ship in the bundle but
 * are not released yet (see `utils/previewFlags.ts`).
 *
 * The USER-FACING copy says "features" and "pages", never "surfaces": `Surface`
 * is the registry's internal term and means nothing to the operator reading the
 * toggle. The component, file and catalog keys keep the code vocabulary on
 * purpose — they name the mechanism, not the copy.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER FEATURE, and everything that belongs to a feature lives inside
 * its card: the headline, the sentence explaining what state it is in, its
 * toggle, and any ingress that only appears once it is on. A reader scanning the
 * page can then take a card as the whole story of one preview, rather than
 * pairing a row against an ingress rendered somewhere below it.
 *
 * The page's own title and the "unpolished on purpose" caveat are NOT repeated
 * here: they are the tab's `label` and `description` in `DeveloperPage.tsx`, and
 * `SidePanelLayout` renders both as the page header.
 *
 * One explicit card per preview flag rather than a loop over a table: the copy
 * has to be a static `i18nT('literal')` call for `check-i18n-keys.mjs` to
 * resolve it, and a table of key strings indexed per card is exactly the dynamic
 * pattern that gate cannot follow. A preview flag is also meant to be
 * short-lived, so the cost of a card is paid once and then deleted with it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT under `pages/settings/`: `gen-settings-registry.mjs` scans
 * that directory and would index these toggles into Settings search, which would
 * advertise the very surface the flag exists to hide.

        the two appear in places far enough apart that discovering the second one
        by flipping the switch is not reliable.

        NO ingress button here, deliberately, unlike the webhooks card above. That
        one needs its link because `/webhooks` is `hiddenFromNav` and the card is
        its ONLY door. Crew is not: flipping this switch puts the Crew Members row
        back on the rail in the same tick (`usePreviewFlagRevision`), so a link
        here would be a second spelling of a door the user can already see — and
        one that costs a catalog key in twelve languages permanently. */}

        NO ingress button, for the same reason as the crew card: turning it on
