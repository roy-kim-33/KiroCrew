/**
 * Full-pane drop affordance for "drag a session into the open chat".
 *
 * The HIT AREA is the whole pane — it is ~10x the composer's area and a shorter
 * travel from the session list, and a release over the transcript that silently
 * did nothing would read as a broken feature rather than a near-miss. But the
 * CUE is anchored on the composer, because that is where the chip actually
 * lands; a label floating mid-transcript taught the wrong mental model (that the
 * session drops into the conversation itself).
 *
 * Rendered only while a session drag is live, so it never sits invisibly over
 * the transcript at rest. `pointer-events-none` is safe *and* required: dnd-kit
 * resolves collisions from measured rects, not DOM hit-testing, so the zone
 * still receives the drop while the chat underneath stays fully interactive.
 *
 * When the dragged session may not be referenced the zone renders a refusal state
 * instead of an invitation, and the two refusals are NOT interchangeable:
 * incognito/temporary is a guard stated plainly, while dropping a session onto
 * its own pane is a harmless mis-aim answered with a recursive joke rather than a
 * warning. Explaining the block beats silently ignoring the drop — and the drop
 * handler refuses independently, so this is the visible half of a guard that does
 * not depend on the UI being reached.

 * appeared in no sibling ring, so a person could be shown an order an agent had
 * set with `chat_folder_move`'s `before` / `after` and had no way to change it.
 * Registering it here closes that, and it closes it by reusing the root path
 * rather than adding a second one: the gesture, the collision band, the
 * renumber and the endpoint are all the ones root rows already use.
 *
 * `siblings` is the ring this row may move within, which is what keeps the two
 * levels from bleeding into each other. Every folder row is now a `folder`
 * droppable, so without it a drag's closest-center fallback could resolve to a
 * row in a different container — a reorder gesture that renumbers nothing,
