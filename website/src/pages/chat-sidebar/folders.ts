  // fall back on, held until a body arrives. Read from the SHARED cache, not
  // from the menu's own optimistic overlay: the folder-suggestion card, the

  // orders for one tree. So a pick re-sorts when the save lands -- the menu's
  // success write puts the accepted value into the cache at that instant and
  // every reader switches together -- and a refused save never leaves the
  // stored order. The fallback draws fine -- it is the order every earlier
  // build drew -- but a sibling drag may not write against it: that renumber is
  // computed from the DRAWN order, and only in the custom mode is that the

   *  board column draws a folder block whatever that attribute says
   *  (`relevantFolders` filters on `isFolderFilteredOut` alone). So on a board the
   *  uncheck does take that block away, and dropping it announces nothing while the

   *  lanes narrow by `isFolderHidden` themselves, so there the uncheck takes nothing
   *  a reader would otherwise have seen, and counting it would over-report.
   *
   *  Hence one predicate and two scopes, not two unrelated counts. A count and not a
