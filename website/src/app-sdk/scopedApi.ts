 * The scoped-API layer of the app SDK: a permission-fenced HTTP client, the host

 * export of it in exact agreement with `public/vendor/kirocrew-app-sdk.mjs` -- so
 * a name placed there is PUBLISHED, and publishing later is additive while
 * un-publishing is a break. `AppScopedApiProvider`'s consumers are two
 * host-internal builtin pages that can import this path directly, so there is
 * nothing an external app needs here yet. Same reasoning as `./identity`.
