 *  that menu must not silently retune these walks. The tree read shares this bound rather than
 *  the listings' 10s because it walks the tree, which is what the figures below timed.
 *  This bounds an unbounded wait, it does not judge staleness — a reply for a
 *  superseded query cannot be shown as the answer to a newer one, since the query key
 *  carries `debouncedQuery` — so a merely slow walk is still worth waiting for.
 *
 *  It has to be, because the timeout path offers recovery: a bound under the honest walk time
 *  fails every attempt alike. The walk is ceilinged, not open-ended (`_WALK_MAX_DIRS_VISITED`
 *  20k dirs, `_WALK_MAX_SCAN_SCOPED` 50k entries), so its worst case follows those ceilings
 *  rather than repo size. Measured on trees that reach a ceiling: an 877k-dir tree 4.20s,
 *  `/var` 0.35s cold against 0.34s warm, `/usr` 0.17s. The worst is 28% of this budget, and
 *  cold-vs-warm moved 2%, so store latency dominates cache state — a store ~3.6x slower than
 *  that tree would exhaust 15s, and no tree size alone can.
 *
 *  Margin: this is the only wall-clock bound on either read — the backend's pool ceiling bounds
 *  how many probes can wedge, not how long a client waits (`_PATH_PROBE_EXEC_CEILING_SECS`). The
 *  search's own work is the ceilinged walk above, worst 4.20s, leaving ~10s of 15 for admission
 *  (2s at most, then a coded 503) and round trips. The tree read's git steps carry per-step kill
 *  switches (`rev-parse` 5s, `ls-files` 15s) that sum PAST this bound on purpose: a git wedged that
 *  long is what the bound is for, and the read rejects here at 15s into the Refresh notice.
 *  The walk figures are local-disk only; a network-mount sample, and a slow-store escape if the
 *  headroom does not hold there, are tracked in #11419 -- until then a timed-out search's Retry /
 *  Refresh re-enters this same bound, deliberately (see lib/withDeadline.ts on retry).
 *
 *  One constant rather than one per surface: a caller's `limit` only caps rows returned
 *  (the server truncates before responding), so a wider page is not a longer walk. */

/** Deadline for the picker/panel listing endpoints (`api.browseFiles`, `api.browseDirs`,
 *  `api.recentProjects`). Its own constant rather than the composer menus' 15s: a listing
 *  is a different endpoint on the same wedged gateway, so retuning the skills menu must
 *  not silently retune folder listings.
 *
 *  Shorter than the search's 15s because a listing is ONE `scandir` plus a per-entry directory
 *  test, so its cost tracks a single directory's ENTRY COUNT rather than tree size. Measured that
 *  way: the widest directory on the dev host, `/usr/share/man/man3` at 8,974 entries, listed in
 *  3.1ms cold against 3.0ms warm — 0.03% of this budget, so cache state is not the term and the
 *  bound tolerates a store some 3,200x slower per entry. Local storage only; no network mount was
 *  available to sample, which is the one case this figure does not cover.
 *
 *  Margin, in place of that sample: this is the only wall-clock bound on the read — the backend's
 *  pool ceiling bounds how many probes can wedge, not how long a client waits, by design. Its own
 *  per-request work is a 2s admission wait at most (then a coded 503, not silence) plus the
 *  millisecond listing above, so healthy work spends under a quarter of the 10s and the rest is
 *  round trips and store latency. A mount whose per-entry stats outrun that remainder rejects HERE
 *  at 10s into the notice (Retry / Refresh) path: the bounded refusal is the designed outcome, not a
 *  hang. No config knob, because a knob asks the user to know a number this comment exists to spare
