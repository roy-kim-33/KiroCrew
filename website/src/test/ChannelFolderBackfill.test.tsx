/**
 * Copy consistency ACROSS a key's plural variants, which no component test can
 * reach: a locale renders only the category its count selects, so a wrong
 * variant is invisible until a user hits that count.
 *
 * This exists because it happened. Two rename passes changed `_one` and
 * `_other` -- the only categories English has -- and left `_many` in es/fr/it/pt
 * and `_few`/`_many` in ru carrying the superseded noun AND missing the folder
 * noun. Russian's `_few` fires at 2-4 and `_many` at 5-20, so those were
 * reachable. A check that reads only English's categories cannot see this class,
 * which is exactly the mistake the first verification pass made.
 *
 * The invariant is language-agnostic: plural category changes how the COUNT
 * agrees, never the phrase that introduces `{{folder}}`. So every variant of one
 * key must carry the same placeholders and the same lead-in to that placeholder.
