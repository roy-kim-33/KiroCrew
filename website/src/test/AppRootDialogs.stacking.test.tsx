/**
 * App-root dialogs render INSIDE the shell's `relative z-[1]` root (App.tsx),
 * not through Modal.tsx's `document.body` portal, so their stacking order is
 * decided against the shell's own ladder:
 *
 *   z-[59]  sessions flyout        z-[60]  flyout drawer morph
 *   z-[61]  rail toggle / peek     62/63   focus-mode rail + mac drag strips
 *   z-[65]  in-shell dialog tier (clears all chat chrome above)
 *   z-[70]  toast / context-menu band
 *   z-[100] full-screen takeovers (update overlay, update-error, update dialogs)
 *
 * An overlay at the chat-pane ceiling `z-50` paints UNDER the flyout stack, so
 * a dialog shown while the chat page is up appears half-hidden behind it. Every
 * App-root dialog's outermost overlay must therefore sit at or above the
 * in-shell dialog tier (`z-[65]`), high enough to clear the flyout, its drawer
 * morph, the rail toggle and the focus-mode rail/drag strips at once.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT: the z-indexes are Tailwind classes jsdom cannot
 * resolve into a paint order, and the invariant is the comparison between them.
