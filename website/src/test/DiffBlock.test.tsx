/* Pierre owns the diff surface: the rows, the gutters, the hunk folding and the
 * file header — filename and ± counts included — are painted inside a shadow
 * root, behind a lazy chunk that only resolves once a test awaits. What is left
 * in the light DOM is what DiffBlock itself contributes: the controls it slots
 * into Pierre's header-metadata area, the path it resolves for Open, and the
 * generating indicator. So every query for one of those awaits, and appearance
 * assertions belong in Playwright instead of here. A patch Pierre cannot parse
 * renders as plain monospace text with no header at all, so no slotted control
 * appears for one.
 *
 * A NEGATIVE assertion about a slotted control therefore has to await the
 * header too, and assert the guard's own observable. Until the chunk resolves
 * Suspense is showing PlainCodeFallback — a plain `<pre>` where no slotted
 * control can exist — so a synchronous `queryByTitle(...)).not.toBeInTheDocument()`
 * passes for the wrong reason and keeps passing with the guard deleted. Each
 * one below waits for `headerMounted()` and then asserts that no existence
 * probe fired, which is the effect's early return made visible. */
