/**
 * Source-level ratchet: no Enter-submit handler may hand-roll the IME guard.
 *
 * The defect this pins is not a bug in one component, it is a SHAPE that spread by
 * copy: `if (e.key === 'Enter' && !ime.isComposing(e)) { e.preventDefault(); … }`
 * puts the consumption inside the guarded condition, so a declined Enter reaches
 * the element and the browser inserts a line break into the text the user is about
 * to send. `ime.claimEnter(e)` owns both halves, so a call site cannot get one
 * right and the other wrong.
 *
 * Two spellings count, because both were found in the tree and they fail
 * differently. Consulting the HOOK (`ime.isComposing(e)`) carries the tracked
 * latch, so it produces the newline. Consulting only the NATIVE flag
 * (`e.nativeEvent.isComposing`) has no latch at all, so instead it re-opens the
 * half-sent-message defect the latch exists to prevent: on WebKit the keydown that
 * commits a candidate reports that flag as false.
 *
 * A behavioural test cannot catch a NEW copy of the shape in a component nobody
 * wrote a test for, which is why this reads the tree instead.
 *
 * There is deliberately no allowlist. An earlier revision exempted whole FILES,
 * which was unsound: one file can hold both an exempt single-line input and a
 * multiline textarea, so the exemption covered a surface it was never meant for.
 * Every Enter-submit branch in the tree now goes through the hook, so the rule can
 * be absolute — which is a cheaper thing to keep true than a list of reasons.
