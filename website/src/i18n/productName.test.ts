/**
 * The `{{productName}}` contract.
 *
 * Catalog values will interpolate the product name instead of hardcoding it,
 * so a downstream edition can rebrand by overriding one variable from its
 * composition root instead of forking every locale file. These tests pin the
 * three properties the arrangement rests on: the stock default renders the
 * exact same English a hardcoded literal would, the variable is wired as an
 * i18next `defaultVariables` (so it survives the planned lazy-catalog
 * migration untouched), and a call-time variable still wins.
 *
 * The tests interpolate against an injected resource rather than a shipped
 * catalog key: the mechanical catalog rewrite lands in follow-up PRs (the
 * full-catalog diff exceeds the reviewable size limit), and this contract
 * must hold independently of how much of the catalog has been converted.
 * The catalog-wide "no non-manifest value hardcodes the literal" invariant
 * ships with the final rewrite chunk, where it can actually pass.
