/**
 * i18n runtime (react-i18next).
 *
 * ## Which catalogs are loaded, and when
 *
 * English is bundled with this module and is always registered: it is the
 * fallback for every missing key, so `t()` never renders a bare key.
 *
 * The browser build boots through `./lazy`, which installs a loader that
 * fetches ONE other catalog on demand as its own chunk. `main.tsx` awaits the
 * stored language's catalog before the first render, so a returning user sees
 * their language on the first paint, and `changeLanguage()` awaits the new
 * catalog before switching. `t()` itself stays SYNCHRONOUS on every path: ~600
 * components call it during render, and nothing suspends.
 *
 * `./all` registers every catalog up front instead. The tests that audit or
 * switch between catalogs use it, so their `t()` works without any `await`.
 *
 * ## Which module owns the imports
 *
 * THIS module imports English only and seeds the registry with it. `./catalogs`
 * owns every static catalog import and `./lazy` the dynamic ones.
 *
 * The split keeps the vitest setup path small: `integration/setup.ts` is a
 * `setupFiles` entry, so its module graph is re-fetched once per test FILE, and
 * reaching all 14 catalogs from here cost more than running the tests. Numbers,
 * and the rules that keep the split in place, live in `website/docs/testing.md`
 * § "What a `setupFiles` entry costs".

 * production registers at module scope before init, while vitest evaluates
 * `setupFiles` — which calls `initI18n('en')` — BEFORE it imports the test file
 * that pulls `./all` in. Before init the registry is simply what
 * `init({ resources })` receives.
 *
 * After init, `addResourceBundle` is what makes the post-init case a stated
 * contract rather than a coincidence: i18next's `ResourceStore` holds the object
 * given to `init({ resources })` BY REFERENCE, so extending the registry in place
 * already reaches the live instance. Registering into the registry alone would
 * rest on that undocumented aliasing, and the day i18next copies instead, every
 * `changeLanguage` test would fall back to English rather than fail.
 *
 * That insurance is not free — `addResourceBundle` deep-copies what it is handed,
 * measured at 67-109 ms for the twelve catalogs, per file that imports `./all`. It
 * is kept unconditional anyway: skipping it for a language the store already holds
 * would silently drop a REPLACEMENT catalog, and ~4 s across the suite is not worth that hole.
