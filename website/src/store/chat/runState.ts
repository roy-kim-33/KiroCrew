/** THE way `activeSlot` moves to `target`: hands the outgoing slot's run
 *  mirror back to its keyed entry, assigns, and records the entry epoch.
 *  Fused into one setter so a future `activeSlot` writer cannot skip the
 *  hand-back -- the same structural shape `setRunState` gives the tick bump.
 *
 *  Why the hand-back exists: while a slot is active every frame writes the
 *  mirror (`slotRunning` / `slotState`) and not its `slotRun` entry, so
 *  without it the entry keeps whatever its last BACKGROUND frame wrote: a
 *  turn that ended on screen leaves the entry busy, and a warm dispatched for
 *  the slot BEFORE it became active cannot see that its run state moved --
 *  the active writers never touched the entry's tick -- so a stale
 *  `running: true` fulfillment would relock the finished pane. The hand-back
 *  is therefore an OBSERVED write of the entry (`setRunState`, tick bumped)
 *  -- but only when the mirror observed something: a mirror whose state
 *  equals the entry's and whose `runEpoch` is unchanged since entry (a
 *  provisional switch in and straight out) is not an observation, and
 *  consuming the tick for it would discard a pending warm that is still the
 *  newest view. A same-value round trip always counts a turn start, so the
 *  epoch check tells it apart from "never moved".
 *
 *  A running mirror that has not streamed yet hands over 'streaming', the
 *  reading the tick-ordered warm gives a turn with no frame -- EXCEPT while
 *  that turn is still an unconfirmed local send (`pendingTurnSlot`): the POST
 *  may yet come back refused, and the `endLocalTurn` that follows clears only
 *  the mirror, so a busy entry parked here would keep the background pane's
 *  indicator on and its composer locked for a turn that never started. Such a
 *  send parks idle; its first frame (or a warm that finds it running)
 *  promotes the entry through the ordered writers.
 *
 *  Two `activeSlot` writers are deliberately NOT routed here, and leave no
 *  slot worth handing back to: `deleteSlot.fulfilled` (the outgoing slot was
 *  just evicted; a hand-back would recreate its entry) and the
 *  `switchSlot.rejected` origin restore (the slot being left is the 404'd
 *  target, which has no entry and never will). */
