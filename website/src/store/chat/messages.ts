   * mcp_oauth banner from "needs auth" to "authenticated" after kiro-cli emits
   * server_initialized, and to retire a banner a newer request superseded.
   * Patches both the active messages array and the slotMessages cache so a slot

   *
   * `ts` is NOT a row identity — two restored rows can carry the same one (see
   * `meta.mid`, which exists for exactly this reason) — so a ts-keyed lookup
   * resolves the first match and two patches for two colliding rows would both
   * land on one of them, leaving the other stale. `mid` is preferred where
   * present; `ts` stays as the fallback for legacy rows written before the id
   * existed and for callers that do not send one. */

  /** Accumulate streamed model reasoning (`chat_thinking` WS event) into a
   *  content-bearing `thinking`-role message — ONE BLOCK PER REASONING BURST.
   *  A turn that reasons, calls a tool, then reasons again therefore renders
   *  two blocks, each above the step it explains. Scanning back to the turn
   *  boundary instead appends every later burst into the FIRST burst's block,
   *  so a multi-tool turn collapsed all of its reasoning under the opening one.
   *
   *  Placement is anchored on the turn's open `streaming` row, located
   *  directly rather than inferred from the array tail: a turn's visible text
   *  accumulates into ONE row that stays open across tool calls (the backend
   *  flushes each segment without broadcasting), and reasoning belongs ABOVE
   *  it, exactly as the `tool` branch inserts ahead of it. The tail is NOT the
   *  end of the turn — an approval row, a queued bubble, a stop event, an
   *  error card and a `file` card are all appended BELOW that open row, so
   *  measuring from `length` would drop the block beneath the answer it
   *  explains. With no open row (reasoning before any text) the block appends,
   *  which is also correct: it lands after whatever opened the turn.
   *
   *  A CONFIRMED steer is injected into the running turn, so reasoning after
   *  it continues the burst it interrupted; an unconfirmed (optimistic) steer
   *  is a raced real turn and does close the burst — see isTurnBoundaryUser.
   *
   *  A `tool` row BELOW that open text row means the rows are already out of
   *  emission order: the `tool` branch steps back over a trailing `streaming`
   *  row but not over an approval row, so an approval-gated call lands beneath
   *  the text. The tool is then the turn's latest step, so the burst that
   *  preceded it is closed and the new one belongs after it — appending is the
   *  only placement that satisfies both, and it is what stops a post-tool
   *  burst being concatenated into the pre-tool block. */
