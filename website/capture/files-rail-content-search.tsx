/**
 * Isolated capture entry for the Files rail's Name/Content search toggle.
 *
 * WHY ISOLATED: the subject is what the rail renders for a CONTENT search over a
 * project that contains both code and documents. Producing that against a live
 * gateway means seeding a repo with a .pptx and an .xlsx whose text happens to
 * match — reproducible only by accident. Stubbing `/api/file-grep` makes the
 * frame deterministic, and the payload is exactly the endpoint's own response
 * shape, so a drift in that contract shows up here as a broken frame.
 *
 * WHAT IS FAITHFUL: the REAL `FileBrowserRail`, the real Pierre tree, the real
 * theme provider and the real i18n catalogs. The mode toggle is CLICKED by the
 * driver rather than seeded, so the frame shows the state a user reaches.
 *
 * `?arm=capped` answers with a truncated, python-engine, documents-skipped
 * payload, which is the status line's other arm — the one that says the search
 * stopped rather than that the text is absent.
 *
 * `?arm=searching` never answers `/api/file-grep` at all, which holds the rail
 * in its in-flight state: the one word over a blank list a reader sees for
 * up to the 2 s budget on a first search.
 *
 * Query string: ?theme=dark&arm=ok|capped|empty|error|searching
