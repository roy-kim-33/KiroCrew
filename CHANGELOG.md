# Changelog

All notable changes to KiroCrew are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0-customapi.5] — 2026-08-08 — Vision

- **MCP servers can now be measured for shareability on purpose, and the answer
  survives until the server itself changes.** The Sharing assessment could only
  say as much as the number of servers carrying a measurement, and reaching one
  was neither deliberate nor durable: the only trigger was an icon-only refresh
  that evaluated two servers per press, so a fleet of thirty needed fifteen
  presses and a guess about what the icon did. MCP Management now carries a
  labelled action that names how much is left ("Measure 2 unmeasured servers")
  and runs the whole set as a background pass with progress, while the
  per-request budget of two stays exactly where it was. Two gaps in the
  measurement itself are closed at the same time. The pre-flight already spawned
  each server twice under two client identities, but compared only the
  `initialize` capabilities, so a server that served a different TOOL SET per
  caller passed; it now compares the tool list too, which costs no extra spawn
  because the probe already fetched it and is the one facet decidable on a server
  too old to send tool annotations at all. Which facet diverged is logged for
  diagnosis but not reported per-row: every consumer of a stored measurement
  reduces it to one boolean, so naming the facet to an operator is a change to
  that whole path rather than to the prober. And a stored verdict now records the
  version the server reported, so a runtime-resolved launch (`npx thing@latest`)
  that swaps its own code upstream is re-measured instead of trusted -- the
  launch fingerprint cannot see that, since command, environment and interpreter
  all stay byte-identical.

- **Switching Kiro accounts mid-session no longer leaves the chat showing a raw
  `The bearer token included in the request is invalid.` with no way out.** A
  `kiro-cli` child holds its credential for the life of the session, so an
  external account switch invalidates it underneath a running session. That
  rejection carries no status code and never uses expiry wording, so it matched
  none of the auth classifiers: it reached the user as the raw upstream string
  with no sign-in affordance, and counted as a retryable backend fault that
  spent the whole retry ladder on a credential no retry can revive. A rejected
  credential is now classified alongside session expiry — terminal, and carrying
  the existing actionable "run `kiro-cli login`, then start a new chat"
  guidance. (#3393)

- **Issue Radar's AI summaries now follow the dashboard language.** The issue
  triage summary, the PR summary, and the label-taxonomy recommendation always
  produced English prose regardless of `dashboard.language`, making the AI card
  the one unlocalized surface in an otherwise localized UI. When a dashboard
  language is configured, each one-shot prompt now carries an output-language
  directive for its prose (summary, per-label `reason`, recommendation
  `rationale`) while label names — and a recommendation's `name`/`description`,
  which become repo content on GitHub — stay untranslated. Caches regenerate on
  a language switch instead of serving the old language: the PR-summary cache
  folds the tag into its fingerprint, and the issue-AI cache stores the tag
  beside the payload and treats a mismatch as a miss (recommendations remain
  regenerate-only via their explicit button). Installs with no configured
  language send byte-identical prompts and keep their cached digests. (#4290)

- **xlsx files now render inline in the file viewer** instead of a
  download-only card. A new `GET /api/file-sheet` endpoint parses OOXML
  workbooks server-side with openpyxl (read-only, worker thread, ZIP
  magic-byte check, 500x100 per-sheet cap with explicit truncation flags) and
  the new `SheetViewer` renders sheet tabs, a column-letter header, and a
  row-number gutter. Formula cells with no cached value — the shape of every
  agent-generated workbook — show the formula source rather than an empty
  cell. Legacy `.xls` and ODF formats keep the download card, and any parse
  failure degrades to it. (#3865)

- **A session that times out on startup now names the MCP server it was waiting
  for.** Every cause of a stalled session start reported the same sentence,
  `Request session/new timed out`, which named none of them: a slow MCP fleet, a
  single unreachable remote server, a pending authorization, and an expired
  credential were indistinguishable. The runtime already held both halves of the
  answer at that moment and threw them away. It sends the server roster in the
  request's own `mcpServers` array, and the reader loop stages every
  `server_initialized` / `server_init_failure` / `oauth_request` frame that
  arrives before the response, each carrying its server's name. A session-start
  timeout now reads both and reports the difference, so the error says how many
  servers reported out of how many were expected, which ones never reported,
  which failed and why, and which are waiting on authorization. `session/load`
  shares the budget and the staging, so it gets the same report. A failed
  server's error text takes the same redaction the dashboard banner applies,
  because a server's startup error can carry its own connection string, and each
  listed name is redacted, collapsed onto one line and length-capped as well --
  a name is config-derived, so an installed app chooses it, and an embedded
  newline would otherwise forge a line in the gateway log while an unbounded one
  would defeat the cap on how many names are listed. The reported count is taken
  against the roster rather than against every staged frame, since the agent
  spec's own servers report too and counting them produced impossible readings
  like "2/1 reported". Timeouts now raise a dedicated `AcpRequestTimeout`, a subclass of
  `AcpRuntimeError`, so a stall is distinguishable from a protocol fault without
  changing what existing handlers catch. Startup telemetry also stops losing the
  starts that failed: the `session_new` phase duration is recorded in a `finally`
  like `session_load` already was, instead of only on success.

- **Subagent rows in System → Sessions now report their process and MCP-stub
  counts.** Both columns rendered an em dash on every task row, which read as
  "a subagent carries no MCP stubs" — the opposite of the truth: a subagent
  session spawns its own poolable stub set and reaches the shared backends
  through the same gateway daemon a top-level session does (measured on a live
  host: 18 `--poolable` stubs under one shared runtime, none of them falling
  back to a private spawn). The reason was structural, not cosmetic: nothing
  ever counted them. `task_memory_rows()` carried no `procs`/`mcp` fields at
  all, and the reaper sweep that samples a task's RSS and CPU took no such
  reading, so the frontend hardcoded both to null. The sweep now counts the
  run's subtree in the same pass (one walk, no extra syscalls per column) and
  attributes the counts the way RSS and CPU are already attributed — split
  across the co-tenants of a shared runtime — with two rules a count needs and
  a byte figure does not: the quotient rounds to a whole process, and a nonzero
  total never rounds down to zero. Unmeasured stays null rather than becoming
  "0", so an unsampled task still reads as an em dash instead of claiming to be
  empty. The stub cmdline fingerprint is now one constant shared by the
  rewriter that emits the launch line and both counters that match it, pinned
  by a test: a private copy that drifted would not fail loudly, it would report
  zero stubs.

- **The subagent cost sweep no longer runs on the gateway event loop.**
  ``_sample_live_costs`` walks ``/proc`` several times per live agent, and the
  reaper called it inline, so every chat turn and heartbeat waited behind those
  walks. It now runs on the maintenance executor. The body was made
  thread-safe to go with it: the agent registry is snapshotted once and the
  sharer count is derived from that snapshot, because iterating the live
  registry from a worker thread raises ``RuntimeError`` the moment a spawn or
  eviction lands mid-sweep.

- **A delivered message no longer warns that it may not have been delivered.**
  Every message typed in the dashboard composer grew a "Message not confirmed —
  may not have been delivered" warning 30 seconds after it was sent, for the rest
  of the turn, while the agent was visibly answering it. The indicator's
  "delivered" signal was a `chat_message` echo of the user row — but that echo is
  suppressed for dashboard sends by design (`DashboardState.append` defaults
  `broadcast_user=False` precisely BECAUSE the composer already rendered the
  bubble; only a row replayed from a channel transcript opts in). So the
  pending-confirmation flag survived every composer send, the 30s sweep flagged
  all of them, and the flag cleared only as a side effect of the end-of-turn
  transcript refresh. Both composer surfaces now confirm from the send's own HTTP
  response, which is the actual delivery receipt: an accepted immediate dispatch
  retires the pending state and keeps the correlation id so a later echo still
  reconciles in place instead of pushing a duplicate bubble. A `queued`
  acceptance is deliberately NOT a receipt for that bubble -- the busy branch
  queues only a non-empty message yet answers `{ok, queued}` either way, and when
  it does queue, its own `queue_push` card owns the message, so cancelling it
  leaves the bubble behind. The genuine failure paths are untouched -- a rejected
  response, a transport error and the 10s client-side abort all leave the bubble
  unconfirmed, which is what the indicator exists to say.

- **Video and audio files now play inline in the file viewer.** Opening
  `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mp3`, `.wav` and friends previously fell through to the
  code renderer, which displayed the binary as mojibake. A new
  `GET /api/file-stream` endpoint serves media with HTTP Range support
  (seeking needs 206 Partial Content) through the same security envelope as
  the other file endpoints -- path validation, sensitive-path block,
  symlink-refusing open, content sniffing so the served bytes decide the
  type, and bounded chunked reads so memory stays constant regardless of
  file size. The viewer routes video to an inline `<video>` player and audio
  to an `<audio>` bar; any playback failure degrades to the download card.
  (#4021)

- **A succeeded publish no longer renders as a blank error, and a failed
  re-publish no longer renders as a success.** The Publish panel recognized only
  the deploy-shaped `{url}` response, so a provider that hands its confirmed
  publish to `POST /api/artifacts/{slug}/publish` — the supported way to reuse the
  core's single publish authorization and audit trail rather than growing a second
  one — got its serialized-artifact response read as "no url", fell through to
  `{url: ''}` and rendered the ERROR branch with an undefined message: a bare red
  icon, no text, on a publish that had in fact succeeded (the bytes were pushed
  and `publication` was persisted). `readPublishOutcome` now reads both shapes and
  returns an outcome rather than a url: success is signalled by the return shape
  instead of inferred from a non-empty url (a destination can publish and expose
  no browsable link), an `error` field wins over anything else in the same body,
  `publication: null` is not success, and an unrecognized shape is reported as a
  NAMED error instead of an empty one. The mirror-image lie is fixed too — a 200
  whose `publication.last_error` is non-empty is now reported as that error rather
  than as "Published!", because `publish_sync.publish()` treats the version push
  as best-effort on a re-publish: it persists the failure and returns normally, so
  the remote content is stale behind a 200. The public-exposure warning and its
  blocking acknowledgment are unchanged and still unconditional.

- **Every builtin app now starts its content 8px from a phone screen edge, not 24px.**
  The narrow-first page gutter (`px-2 md:px-6`) reached the core pages and Issue
  Radar, while the remaining builtin apps kept an unconditional `px-6`, so their
  content was inset 24px before any card inset stacked on top. Meetings, Code
  Review Sage, Auto Research, Workflows, Mochi, Papyrus, PPTX Maker and Ops
  Mission Control now carry the same gutter, converted a whole file at a time so
  a header and the rows beneath it cannot render on two different left edges.
  Centered empty states keep their `px-6`, where it is the element's only inset
  and flushing it would push centered copy toward the edge for no width gain; a
  guard test states that exclusion so a later pass does not read it as a miss.

- **Destructive buttons look destructive on a phone.** `Btn`'s `danger`
  variant coloured its label only on `:hover`, and a touch viewport never
  produces `hover` — so a destructive button rendered identically to the
  non-destructive buttons beside it. Same class of defect as a hover-revealed
  control: the affordance existed only under a pointer. Found on the Channels
  page at 390px, where `Close` (which dismisses every agent in the channel) sat
  in a wrapped header row beside the frequent `3 agents` and `Clear Context`
  buttons at identical visual weight. The label is now `text-danger`
  unconditionally; hover still raises the border and adds a subtle fill, so the
  pointer affordance is not lost, only made unnecessary for recognising the
  control. (#3937)

- **A parent agent can read its own sub-agent's result file again on a host
  whose home is a symlink.** The result path handed back in a completion event
  was built through `Path.resolve()`, which is correct for the traversal check
  it exists to serve and wrong for a path somebody is told to go read: on an
  Amazon cloud desktop, where `/home/<user>` is a symlink to
  `/local/home/<user>`, that resolved spelling carries a `/local/home/...`
  prefix the reader's own path allowlist -- keyed on the `$HOME` it was given --
  does not match. The file was always readable; only the spelling was
  unrecognized. So the read was refused, and refused as an approval prompt that
  times out rather than as an error, which made a whole wave of sub-agent
  results look unreadable while the parent concluded it lacked permission.
  Paths emitted as TEXT (the completion event, the batch digest, `spawn_status`,
  the prior-result hint on an unresumable conversation, and `info.result_path`
  wherever it surfaces) now carry the declared home spelling, while every path
  used to open a file stays symlink-resolved so the traversal check is unchanged.
  Validation is delegated to the resolving helper rather than duplicated, so the
  two cannot drift apart.
- **Code Review Sage's "Ask the reviewer" no longer dies with the review's
  session.** The reviewer's reasoning lives in the session that produced the
  findings, and that session was kept resident only briefly — a 1800s idle TTL,
  a 6h cap, a 4-session LRU cap, and gateway restart. Worse than "unloaded":
  retiring it called `handle.destroy()`, which unlinks the kiro-cli transcript
  unless `keep_transcript` is set, so the reasoning was DELETED and no amount of
  waiting or re-opening could bring it back. Sage now keeps the transcript and
  a follow-up RESUMES it as an ordinary chat session (`session/load`), filed in
  a `Sage Review` folder and titled `followup-pr#<n>-<title>`. Nothing is held
  resident between the review and the question: asking is the rare case, so a
  follow-up pays a cold load from disk instead of pinning the shared reviewer
  subprocess on the chance that someone asks. Because the follow-up is a normal
  session, its tool use now runs through the dashboard's approval pipeline,
  which sees real permission requests and can reject BEFORE execution — closing
  the documented limitation that Sage's own gate was post-hoc for
  spec-pre-approved tools. A resume that would not restore the review is refused
  rather than attempted: the dashboard's fallback for a failed resume is to
  replay Kiro Crew's conversation log, and a follow-up session has none, so a
  session opened anyway would answer confidently about a review it knows nothing
  about; the same reason a run that is still going is not offerable, since a
  second coverage pass can replace the findings a mid-run conversation was
  opened on. Follow-up offers are retired after two weeks with no activity,
  measured from the transcript's own mtime so a conversation still in use keeps
  its offer. Retiring an offer removes only Sage's own descriptor: the one
  session id available there comes from a file the reviewer can write, so
  deleting on that authority would let a prompt-injected review name any session
  on the machine and have this app remove it.

- **A long-running cron job's next tick is no longer dispatched up to 30s
  late.** A job is invisible to the scheduler's wake computation while it's
  executing (`_next_wake_secs` skips anything in `self._executing`), so for
  a job whose run takes most of its interval, the timer's last wake before
  completion — capped at the 30s poll interval — is what the next dispatch
  had to wait for, since finishing a job never re-armed the timer. Measured
  in the field on a 60s-interval job with a ~57s run: 20% of ticks landed
  ≥20s late, costing roughly double the job's own `interval - duration`
  idle-time floor. Job completion now re-arms the timer with its real
  next-due delay. The naive version of this fix is unsafe: a job's
  completion runs on its own task, not the timer's, so a blind
  `_arm_timer()` call racing the timer's own in-flight dispatch sweep
  (`_on_timer`, yielded at its worker-thread scan) would cancel that sweep
  mid-flight and drop any due jobs not yet spawned for that tick. A job
  completing in that narrow window now no-ops instead — `_on_timer`'s own
  tick already unconditionally re-arms once the sweep finishes, by which
  point the completed job is no longer `_executing`, so the corrected delay
  still gets picked up, just moments later rather than being computed
  twice.

- **Reload session: relaunch a session's agent process in place.** A live
  agent process mounts its MCP servers and builds its tool table once, at
  session-init time, so config that changes afterwards — a newly added MCP
  server, an env or agent-spec fix — never reaches an already-open session;
  the only remedies were restarting the whole gateway or abandoning the
  conversation for a new chat. The session actions menu now carries a
  "Reload session" item (disabled while a turn runs) backed by
  `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/reload`: it targets the slot's linked session
  key, applies the cancel-route app-isolation policy, refuses with 409 while
  a turn is in flight or sub-agent children are attached, tears the process
  down through the same chokepoint the agent/workspace switches use, appends
  a feed notice, and eagerly re-arms the resume spawn, so the relaunched
  process re-reads its agent spec and environment and re-initializes MCP
  servers via session/load with the conversation preserved. The busy check
  is evaluated atomically with the session pop, closing the check-then-reset
  race, and the notice kind is skipped by the last-real-message scans on
  both backend and frontend.

- **Removing a worktree in Dev Fleet no longer strands its pod's isolated
  HOME.** Reclamation was gated on the pod's unit still being ACTIVE, which the
  ordinary path never is: you stop the pod when testing ends and prune days
  later once the PR merges. So the delete path that reclaims the HOME was
  effectively never called, and every removal leaked a full isolated
  `KIROCREW_HOME` — dominated by a per-instance copy of the embedding model, so
  ~0.6 GB each — with the directory becoming unattributable the moment the
  worktree's env pin went away. Removal now reclaims the HOME whether or not the
  pod is running, using the same `orphan_homes` predicate as `pod ls` / `pod
  prune` (so symlinks are skipped, and a macOS name mid-`up` is treated as
  installed rather than orphaned). Attribution and teardown are ONE transaction
  held under `pod_name_mutex`: pod identities are global basenames, so checking
  ownership in one process and tearing down in another leaves a window where a
  concurrent `pod up` from a different checkout claims the same name and the
  teardown would stop that pod and delete its HOME. Both call sites — the
  live-unit path and the orphaned-HOME path — go through the one locked helper,
  which is necessarily in-process: the mutex is held per open-file-description
  and `stop_pod` re-acquires it, so holding it around a `pod down` shell-out
  would block the child being waited on. Because the delete needs positive
  attribution, an ABSENT checkout pin refuses rather than assuming ownership
  (`pod prune` still reclaims those), and a name handed to a new pod mid-teardown
  refuses the removal outright, since that pod may be running out of the very
  worktree about to be deleted.
  The two outcomes are reported separately (`stopped_pod` vs
  `reclaimed_pod_home`) rather than conflated into a shutdown that never
  happened. Liveness checks keep failing CLOSED — they guard against deleting a
  checkout under a live pod — while a reclamation that cannot run now degrades
  to a logged leftover instead of refusing the removal, and a provably absent
  pod backend logs the HOME it is leaving behind at WARNING with the verb that
  reclaims it, replacing a debug-level line that hid the residue entirely.

- **The one-time config migration no longer leaves a `.json.bak` orphan beside a
  config path it does not own.** `KiroCrewConfig.load()` copied the
  pre-migration config to `<path>.bak`, where `<path>` is whatever
  `config_path()` resolved to -- so every caller that redirects the loader at
  its own `tempfile` entry (tests and embedders do) silently accumulated one
  orphan per load, since the caller unlinks the path it created and never learns
  a sibling appeared. One dev host reached 72,327 such files in `/tmp`, 7% of a
  tmpfs inode budget whose exhaustion fails every process on the box. The copy
  is now gated on the config living in `config_dir()`, the one directory whose
  contents we own; the production backup is unchanged, and a copy that fails
  still aborts the migration save exactly as before, so a config we could not
  copy aside is not rewritten either. The name is also built by
  appending rather than `with_suffix(".json.bak")`, which REPLACED the final
  suffix and so renamed a non-`*.json` config instead of backing it up.


- **A knowledge source that errored during ingestion is no longer re-synced on
  every sweep.** `KnowledgeIngestion` marks failure in the `sync_status`
  **column**, but `SyncScheduler.sync_all`'s skip predicate read only the
  `sync_status` copy inside the properties JSON, which the ingestion path never
  sets. So an ingestion-errored source (bad credentials, deleted remote,
  unparseable content) was retried on every sweep forever, flooding logs with
  the same failing network call and giving the user no way to quiesce it short
  of deleting the source. `sync_all` now treats an `'error'` value in EITHER
  store as errored (legacy JSON-only rows are still skipped), and
  `_record_failure` writes the column alongside the properties copy it keeps for
  `consecutive_failures`.

- **`test_redaction_timing_scales_linearly` no longer fails CI
  intermittently** (observed "Redaction scaled super-linearly: 3.2x, limit
  3.0x" on an otherwise-healthy matcher). The test took ONE
  `perf_counter` sample per input size, so it billed itself for whatever
  the OS gave the core to the sibling pytest-xdist workers — and one
  unlucky reading of the SMALL input, the ratio's denominator, was enough
  to push it over the bound. It now measures with `time.thread_time()`
  (redaction is single-threaded pure-regex work, so per-thread CPU is its
  complete cost) and takes best-of-3 per size, since scheduler noise only
  ever adds and the minimum is the closest estimate of the true cost —
  the same two techniques `TestIsDeniedReDoSResistance` already uses for
  this class of assertion. The 3.0x bound is unchanged and detection is
  intact: a genuinely quadratic implementation still measures ~4.3x.
**Big feature: native vision — image models feel first-class, not bolted on.**

![Vision tool — describe any image on a text-only model](assets/vision-tool.png)

Every model now reports `supports_vision`; the picker groups **Vision — image input** (muted **Image** pill) above **Text**, and **Settings → Chat → Vision** governs how text-only models handle images (describe subagent / switch / off + fallback model). Attach any image via the composer's `+` / drag-drop — it rides as native pixels on vision models, or as a one-shot `vision_subagent_describe` on text-only ones (the `vision_analyze` MCP tool is also available to the agent). Images are downscaled to model limits before they ever reach the gateway.

### Added

- **`vision_analyze` MCP tool** — the main agent can describe any local path or http(s) image URL on demand (`vision_analyze({ path|url })`), so screenshots the agent itself captures enter the conversation as text.
- **Vision-aware image routing** — `prompt_blocks` downscales + `vision.decide_image_input_mode` routes `auto` → native vs text; `AcpClient` + shared-runtime `AcpSessionHandle` both honor it so Slack/cron/dashboard share one implementation. Two new config keys surface in `config.json` (`agent.image_input_mode: auto|native|text`, `agent.image_redirect: subagent|switch|off`) and the new Settings card.
- **Reported `supports_vision` flag** — every `GET /api/models` row carries it (registry `supports_vision` + router catalog `capabilities` + ACP `oc/ol deepseek-v4-flash` denylist), wired `AcpAdapter` → `ModelDropdownList` grouping.
- **Multi-provider picker — full catalogs** — `oc/` (opencode-go) and `ol/` (ollama) now expose their full catalogs (mimo-v2.5, glm, kimi, minimax, qwen, gemma, …), with 9router `ocg`/`ollama` normalization so `oc/mimo-v2.5`, `ol/glm-5.2` etc. are selectable end-to-end.
- **Settings → Chat → Vision** — native `Image input mode`, `On text-only models`, and `Vision fallback model` selects, right next to Default Model. The model picker's Vision grouping is derived from the reported flag, not a hard-coded client list.

### Fixed

- AppImage gateway startup blockers (packaged-build path) and shared-runtime image prompt parity.

## [0.2.0-customapi.4] — 2026-08-08

The kirocrew-customapi fork: Kiro Crew with the Claude Code ACP backend re-enabled for self-hosted LLM routers (9router, CLIProxyAPI, OpenCode Zen, Ollama Cloud, and any Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

### Fixed

- **Endless loading in chat (OpenCode backend)** — the OpenCode ACP process now runs in an isolated `HOME`, so user-installed plugins (Honcho) and MCP servers can no longer stall the session.
- **Ollama Cloud 405/Unauthorized** — Ollama Cloud's Anthropic endpoint rejects cloud API keys; the wire format is now forced to OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`) which accepts the same keys and models.
- **Provider preset reset to "custom"** — the preset now derives from the saved URL, so it stays selected after save + reload.
- **"connection failed: undefined" on Test** — the provider test now uses the stored API key when no draft key is entered.
- **Stale model from old provider** — switching provider clears the default model and model whitelist, so old ids (e.g. `deepseek-v4-flash:0731`, `oc/mimo`) no longer leak into the new provider's picker.
- **Router-prefixed models in kiro-native** — `cx/`, `oc/`, `ol/` prefixed models are cleared on provider switch and no longer appear in the kiro-native model list.

### Added

- **Provider binary warnings** — Settings > Chat now warns when the selected backend's binary (OpenCode CLI or claude-agent-acp) is not installed.
- **New provider presets** — Ollama Cloud (OpenAI wire), OpenCode Zen/Go, commandcode.ai, 9router, CLIProxyAPI, OmniRouter, Anthropic, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Together, OpenAI, Groq.

### Verified

- 767 Python tests + frontend tests pass.
- Live AppImage chat returns instantly.
- All 14 provider URLs verified (200 or auth-required).

## [0.2.0-customapi.1] — 2026-08-06

- **Apply & Restart now really mounts a newly installed server, and says so
  honestly when it cannot.** The restart path runs the one serialized
  discover→write entry point and reconciles the consumed agent config
  unconditionally, so an edit that produces an empty discovery delta (a
  `disabled: true` flip, a changed `env`) is still written out instead of
  being skipped as "nothing new". A reconcile that FAILS is reported through
  `mcp_sync_ok` on the restart response rather than being dressed up as a
  successful apply.

- **Publishing an artifact to the public internet now requires an explicit
  acknowledgment, and an operator can remove the path entirely.** The warning
  next to each confirm button could be scrolled past and read as decoration, and
  the public-web destination was the one publish destination exempt from the
  operator's publish policy — `deploy-web-aws` was appended to
  `/api/publish-providers` unconditionally and `POST /api/deploy/deploy` consulted
  no ceiling, so a team that had closed every other destination still had a
  one-click path to a world-readable URL. Every surface that creates the public
  resource (the Publish panel, its scan-override branch, and **Confirm deploy** on
  a pending entry) now ends at a blocking dialog that names the artifact, states
  that anyone with the link can view it, states how long the link stays public,
  and requires pressing **I understand, publish publicly** — a button that is
  neither pre-focused nor the default action, so no keystroke that dismisses an
  ordinary dialog can publish by accident. The destination itself now goes through
  the same `capabilities.publish` chokepoint as artifact publish: closing it in the
  trust-root policy (or narrowing `publish.allowed_destinations` in `config.json`)
  removes the button from the provider registry **and** answers 403 from
  `/api/deploy/deploy` and `/api/deploy/pending/{id}/confirm`, including for the
  agent-mediated `deploy_artifact` preview. Operators who had already narrowed
  `publish.allowed_destinations` must add `deploy-web-aws` to keep deploying. (#3599)

- **The Linux desktop app no longer shows two title bars on GNOME-family
  Wayland desktops.** The window manager's native decoration used to stack on
  top of the dashboard's own 42px header, wasting vertical space and
  duplicating controls. On Wayland sessions of desktops that prefer
  client-side decorations (GNOME, Ubuntu, Unity, Pantheon, Budgie) the window
  now drops the native frame: the header doubles as the title bar via an
  injected drag region, and a minimize/maximize/close cluster is injected at
  the header's top-right (frameless Linux gets no OS-painted controls, unlike
  the macOS traffic lights and the Windows caption overlay). X11 sessions,
  desktops that expect server-side decorations (KDE, XFCE, tiling window
  managers — including hybrids like Regolith that also report a GNOME token),
  and unknown environments keep the native frame: frameless X11 windows lose
  mouse edge-resize, which would be worse than the doubled bar. The
  `linuxFrameless` key in the desktop app's own config (Connection → Open
  Config File, also in the tray menu; read once at launch) forces either
  shape. On frameless windows the menu bar auto-hides (press Alt to reveal
  it) — kept visible it would re-create the stacked-bars problem, removed it
  would take the menu away entirely. Connection windows follow the same
  decision. (#3606)

- **A lesson from a previous embedding-model generation could no longer get
  silently deleted or offered as a false contradiction.** `write_lesson`'s
  semantic dedup and `find_contradiction_candidates` compared raw embeddings
  with a cosine helper that silently truncated a dimension mismatch to the
  shorter vector instead of rejecting it, so a row embedded at a different
  dimensionality (e.g. left over from an old embedding model) could score a
  plausible-looking ~0.5 similarity against an unrelated new rule — landing
  either past the 0.85 dedup line (deleting the old lesson as a "duplicate")
  or inside the [0.4, 0.85) contradiction band (offered as a false
  contradiction candidate). Both paths now converge onto the same
  dimension-checked, float64-precision scorer the ranking paths already use,
  which also removes a per-row query re-derivation from both loops. (#3466)

- **Computer use no longer costs a 109 MB backend process per chat when it is
  off — or on platforms where it cannot run at all.** `kirocrew-computer` was
  registered into the agent spec unconditionally, and the keystone enable was
  only checked *inside* the process the spec had already caused kiro-cli to
  spawn: it suppressed the tool list, never the process. Every chat process paid
  ~109 MB for a disabled capability, including every `spawn_run` subagent, and
  on Linux/Windows it paid that for a feature with no driver (macOS is the only
  supported platform) — measured at 16 processes / 1.75 GB on one Linux host.
  The server is now withheld from the emitted spec, unless this is macOS *and*
  the keystone is on; enabling it from Settings rebuilds the spec before
  restarting sessions, so the tools still appear in the session you are sitting
  in. Your `tools` entries are left untouched — a ref whose server the spec does
  not define resolves to nothing, so a mount you had narrowed to a single tool
  comes back exactly as you left it. Only the entry's own `autoApprove` and
  custom `env` keys are reset by an off/on cycle and need re-applying,
  deliberately: restoring an approval from a file the agent can write would
  bypass the PreToolUse gate. The two in-process checks are kept as defence in
  depth for a mid-session disable. (#3482)

- **Folder-write audit lines now name the internal component that made the
  write, instead of inferring the caller's identity from the internal secret's
  presence.** Every MCP stdio server now declares its component name on
  loopback gateway requests (`X-Internal-Caller`, attached centrally by the
  shared request helpers), and the folder endpoints validate it against a
  known-caller set before trusting it into the security event log's `caller`
  field — `source` stays in SEL's interface vocabulary (`mcp`), so operator
  queries over `source == "mcp"` keep matching folder writes. The old
  inference was correct only while exactly one internal caller existed — a
  second internal caller would have silently inherited the same label. An
  authenticated internal write with a missing or unrecognized caller name is
  audited as `caller="unknown-internal"` with a warning, so a new caller shows
  up loudly until it is added to the known set alongside its own test. Browser
  writes still audit as `dashboard`; the caller header alone grants nothing.
  (#3503)

- **`kirocrew policy show` no longer hides the 139 built-in denied-command
  rules from the agent.** The rules are visible and configurable to the
  user (Settings → Security), but the agent's only way to discover them was
  to attempt a command and be refused — so it could plan multi-step work
  that turned out to be impossible from the first step, walking the user
  through setup effort (e.g. exporting AWS credentials) for a task a
  hard-denied command would block later anyway. `policy show` now prints
  the rule count grouped by category on every install, enterprise policy or
  not; `--ids` lists each category's rule ids for citing a specific rule
  when relaying a refusal. (#3454)

- **Side-panel oversize-question refusal now reports an accurate character
  target for every script, not just emoji.** The refusal derived its
  character count from a fixed worst-case floor (4 bytes/char, the emoji
  case), so an ASCII user over the byte budget was told to cut to ~8,192
  characters when trimming a single character would do (4x over-deletion),
  and a zh-CN user (3 bytes/char) was told 8,192 when ~10,922 actually fit.
  The target is now derived from the submitted question's own byte density,
  so it's accurate per script — the all-emoji case is unaffected (it already
  sat at the 4-byte floor). (#3432)

- **The skill browser no longer serves a different skill than the one you asked
  for.** Three `package/` lookups compared a bare leaf name and returned the
  first hit, so a request for `package/<name>` could answer with a file under
  `<root>/<Pkg>/<name>`, or with whichever of two identically named files the
  filesystem happened to yield. Exact keys now decide first, leaf matching
  survives only where it is unambiguous, and a real collision resolves to
  nothing — a 404, with the competing candidates logged — because the
  `package/<path>` key cannot express which of the two files was meant. Every
  lookup that previously resolved correctly still resolves to the same file.
  **Edition maintainers:** roots the core already keys itself (`~/.kiro/skills`,
  the data home, configured extra paths) are no longer *also* enumerated under
  `package/`, which previously presented an editable skill as a read-only
  package one. A stored reference to one of those duplicate `package/` keys
  stops resolving; the file itself is untouched and still reachable under its
  canonical key, but the stored reference has to be re-pointed. (#3369)

- **MCP gateway daemons no longer leak when their launcher dies.** A `gatewayd`
  whose launcher exited without signalling it (a torn-down `pytest` run, for
  example) used to stay resident forever — invisible to every sweep, ~27 MB
  each, accumulating without bound. The daemon now watches its own listening
  socket path and gracefully self-exits once the path is gone (three
  consecutive checks, POSIX only), and the untracked-orphan sweep reaps any
  gatewayd whose `--socket` path no longer exists on disk, TERM-first so
  pooled backends drain cleanly. (#3315)

- **Aggregate memory ceiling across all concurrent agent spawns.** The cgroup
  memory limit was per-spawn only (65% of RAM each), so many concurrent
  subagents could collectively request several times host RAM without any
  single limit breaching. The gateway now also caps their shared parent slice
  (`kirocrew-agents.slice`) at 80% of RAM plus an aggregate task ceiling —
  override via `resource_limits.max_total_memory_mb` /
  `max_total_processes` — and logs which scopes were OOM-killed when the
  aggregate ceiling engages. (#3316)

- **Slack manifest: private channels now work out of the box.** The shipped app
  manifest adds the `groups:history` and `users:read` bot scopes and subscribes
  to the `message.groups` event, so a tracked private channel actually delivers
  messages and profile lookups resolve real names. **Existing installs are not
  fixed by upgrading alone**: Slack only grants new scopes on reinstall — update
  the app's manifest (or re-import it), then reinstall the app to the workspace
  and copy the new bot token. (#3206)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-17

The agent gained its own browser and can now run several threads of your work at
once. Sessions explain themselves when you come back to them, the dashboard grew
a Git panel and a docking side panel, Linux ARM64 and Windows join the
first-class builds, and you can talk to it by holding a key.

### Before you upgrade

- **Node.js 22 is now the minimum** (24 LTS recommended). A Node 20 install is
  refused rather than failing partway through a frontend build.
- **Multi-account Telegram is withdrawn.** Only a single bot token is accepted;
  move the token you want served to `telegram.bot_token`. Existing config is
  still parsed and preserved, but nothing reads the account map.
- **`kirocrew logout` now revokes refresh tokens**, not just access tokens, so
  logging out actually ends the session everywhere.
- **The terminal no longer scans its output for credentials.** That scan was
  corrupting CJK text and emoji in the PTY stream, and it swallowed secrets you
  printed deliberately. Terminal output is now passed through untouched.
- **Knowledge auto-ingest is opt-in.** A fresh install ingests nothing, and
  spends nothing on extraction, until you switch it on.

### Run several threads at once

- **Crew Mode** — Send the next message without waiting for the last one. Topics
  are dispatched to parallel sub-sessions and answers arrive independently, so
  one chat advances several pieces of work at the same time.
- **Session summaries** — A side-panel tab says what each thread of a session was
  trying to do and where it landed, with anything still open hoisted to the top.
  Old sessions can be summarised on demand. Opt-in, with its token cost stated.
- **Sessions resume instantly** — An earlier chat loads in the background while
  you read it, so the first message sends immediately instead of waiting on a
  cold start, and switching back restores your reading position.
- **You can watch the context fill up** — The composer reports consumption as a
  percentage and a token count, and the turn-stats footer names the model that
  actually served the turn, which matters when you are running on Auto.
- **A wedged turn recovers itself** — A stuck tool, a dead process, or a frozen
  model call is detected and nudged back to life instead of hanging silently.
- **Pinned messages, and a session that admits it needs you** — Pin messages for
  reference; a session waiting on your answer says so instead of looking idle,
  and one running a monitoring loop stays under "In progress" between cycles.

### The agent gets its own browser

- **The Browser panel is the browser** — The agent drives the dashboard's own
  side panel directly: navigate, click, type, screenshot. Browsing happens where
  you are already looking, with no second window and no security prompt. The
  Playwright CLI remains for remote sessions and for a browser you are already
  logged into.
- **Nothing to install first** — Browsing no longer needs Node or npm on the
  machine. A private, verified copy is fetched for you, so a locked-down laptop
  is one click from a working browser rather than a dead end.
- **Computer Use is offered only where it works** — Native desktop automation
  appears on macOS, instead of everywhere and then failing.

### New surfaces in the dashboard

- **A Git panel** — Repository status and commit log in the side panel, opening
  automatically alongside the folder tab once a session has a project.
- **The side panel docks to the bottom** — As well as the right, toggled from the
  panel header, which suits a tall or narrow monitor.
- **Issue links become chips** — GitHub, GitLab, and Jira issue, PR, and MR URLs
  render inline as icon plus `owner/repo#N`, and a Jira link shows the issue's
  details in the side panel instead of sending you away.
- **Feature Previews has its own page** — Preview opt-ins moved out of Developer
  → Config into per-feature cards, and Webhooks moved into Settings rather than
  holding a top-level nav slot.
- **A redesigned session list** — Tighter rows with a colour bar, a status gutter
  and a meta line, so session state is scannable; folders can be dragged onto
  each other to nest them in board view.
- **Crew members keep an activity log** — Each member of a crew gets its own
  space with a persistent log of what it has been doing.
- **Link previews, and previews that explain themselves** — URL unfurls now work
  in your own messages as well as the agent's, and previewing the dashboard's own
  address explains the loop instead of rendering a blank frame.

### Faster

- **The first message no longer stalls** — Embedding thread pinning cuts the
  opening turn's latency from roughly 7.4 seconds to about 350 milliseconds.
- **A cold dashboard load moves a quarter of the bytes** — Pre-compressed assets
  take it from 7.8 MB to 1.85 MB, which is what a remote or tunnelled dashboard
  feels most.
- **Dictation is about twice as fast** on a many-core host, and no longer spikes
  to thirty seconds under load.
- **Streaming is smoother** — Block parsing is throttled during a stream, so a
  long reply no longer builds quadratic pressure as it renders.

### Two new apps, and a store worth browsing

- **Personal Shopper** — Researches real stores on your behalf and recommends
  something only when buying actually helps. It diagnoses the problem first, and
  never touches a cart.
- **Issue Radar Crews** — Put autonomous workers on claimed issues. Each crew
  takes an issue into its own worktree, posts progress to a public claim ledger,
  and pushes a pull request: hands-free from triage to code review.
- **A curated App Store** — Discover renders editorial spotlights, themed
  collections, and category rails with curator artwork, not one flat list.
- **Meetings keeps the transcript** — Stored and shown beside the agent's notes,
  and it survives a reload.
- **Ask Code Review Sage why** — The reviewer stays available after it posts, so
  you can question a finding instead of starting over.
- **Research Lab and Spec Builder pick their own model** — Instead of always
  falling through to your chat default.
- **A public deploy asks first** — Publishing an artifact publicly requires an
  explicit acknowledgement, and an operator can close the path entirely.

### Reach it from anywhere

- **Linux ARM64** — A native aarch64 desktop build, published with an
  architecture check so nobody downloads the wrong one.
- **Windows is a first-class build** — The same targets as macOS and Linux, with
  its own install guide.
- **Summon it from any app** — A system-wide hotkey (Cmd+Shift+K on macOS,
  Alt+Shift+K elsewhere) raises the dashboard. Reconfigurable, or off.
- **Change release channel without reinstalling** — Move between Stable, Insider,
  and Nightly from About, and the gateway restarts in place after an update.
- **Publish it on your tailnet** — `kirocrew tailnet up` puts the dashboard on
  your Tailscale network, reachable from your other devices.
- **Launch a cloud crew from the dashboard** — Remote EC2 provisioning, device
  sign-in included, as a restartable job rather than a CLI session you must not
  close, and `--subnet` pins it into a private subnet.
- **One title bar on GNOME** — On desktops that draw their own decorations the
  duplicate native title bar is gone; the dashboard header does the job.
- **Connect to a gateway you run elsewhere** — A Developer setting stops the
  desktop app from starting its own local one.
- **Keep on Top** — Pin the window above everything else, remembered across
  restarts.

### Voice, terminal, and files

- **Push to talk** — Hold a key to dictate, or tap to latch it on. The key, the
  mode, and a live test strip are in Settings.
- **The terminal docks where you want it** — Bottom or right, opening in the
  session's own project directory, with your preferred shell.
- **Images are kept as artifacts** — Screenshots and diagrams the agent produces
  are preserved with a gallery, a detail page, and metadata.
- **Reveal a file on disk** — Jump from the file viewer to its folder, named for
  the file manager your platform actually has.
- **Mermaid diagrams enlarge** — Click one for a lightbox instead of squinting at
  inline width.

### Channels

- **Dashboard replies mirror back** — An answer you send from the dashboard is
  relayed into the Discord or Telegram conversation it came from.
- **Telegram has a real command menu** — Type `/` for autocomplete, switch models
  with inline buttons, toggle auto-approve, and see markdown tables render as
  tables rather than raw pipes.
- **WeChat accepts attachments** — Photos, voice memos, and documents reach the
  agent instead of being dropped.
- **A channel can file its own sessions** — Point a channel at a named sidebar
  folder and its conversations group themselves there.
- **Too many choices degrade gracefully** — An option list past a platform's cap
  becomes a numbered text list instead of silently losing the extra choices.

### Tools and connections

- **Connecting takes one click** — Connect mints the provider's approval link
  immediately and consent finishes on the card, instead of waiting for a later
  chat to trigger the challenge.
- **Pooling works itself out** — Kiro Crew probes which MCP servers can safely
  share a process. A per-server choice replaces the old global switch and its
  guesswork.
- **Per-agent tool sets** — Assign servers to particular agents so each sees its
  own surface without editing global config, and the agent picker offers the
  project-local agents found in the active session.
- **Tune how tools defer** — Decide how aggressively Tool Search hides tools
  until they are needed, trading context for immediacy.
- **Authenticated custom servers** — Supply request headers when adding a remote
  MCP server, instead of hand-editing a file.
- **`kirocrew policy show` lists the denied-command catalog**, so you can read
  what is blocked without going to the source.

### Autonomy with a governor

- **It knows when the machine is full** — Scheduled jobs defer and new subagents
  are refused when memory is critically low, and the header shows the posture so
  you know before heavy work fails.
- **Each job sets its own time budget** — Up to 24 hours, replacing one fixed
  thirty-minute cap, and a job's instructions can run to 50,000 characters.
- **Read a script job without a terminal** — Its Python source is shown,
  highlighted and read-only, in the job's detail view.
- **Monitoring keeps its schedule** — Talking to a session mid-loop no longer
  restarts the countdown, so checks land when they were meant to.
- **A blip is not a failure** — Transient throttles and server errors retry
  instead of counting toward auto-pause, a success resets the failure count, and
  an unattended loop that loses tool approval says so instead of dying quietly.
- **Subagents ask for permission like the main agent** — A subagent's approval
  request now goes through trust, auto-approve, or a prompt, instead of being
  dropped and leaving the child wedged.

### Memory and knowledge

- **Lessons surface by relevance** — Applicable older corrections stop decaying
  out of context as the library grows, and a lesson keeps its "not this" clause
  as a field of its own.
- **Knowledge spending is bounded** — A sweep budget, per-source rate limits and
  caps, a configurable extraction model, visible per-source cost, the files it
  failed on, and JSON Lines, NDJSON and Org Mode among the formats it accepts.
- **A tidier artifact library** — Sortable columns that remember their order, a
  copy-content button, and a header that stays put while you scroll.
- **Your own skills survive an upgrade** — A skill you wrote whose name collides
  with a bundled one is no longer deleted on startup.

### Security and governance

- **An app sees only its own events** — Installed apps receive the event scopes
  their manifest declares, and can no longer observe your chats, your scheduled
  job results, or another app's activity.
- **Scheduled jobs are re-vetted every run** — Checked against current policy
  each time they fire rather than only when created, and a restored backup can no
  longer smuggle shell commands past the approval system.
- **The memory ceiling covers everything at once** — The cap applies to all
  concurrent agents together, so many small spawns can no longer exhaust the host
  between them.
- **Credentials are scrubbed on the live stream** — Redaction now covers
  real-time output as well as replayed history.
- **A pinned policy floor cannot be lowered locally** — On a governed host the
  policy wins over local configuration, including over the unsandboxed-exec
  opt-in.
- **Memory edits require a recognised session**, closing a path where a forged
  key could delete stored memory.
- **Bring your own identity provider** — Administrators can authorise their own
  OAuth providers by configuration, without waiting for a release.

### Notable fixes

For anyone who wants to know whether their particular annoyance is gone.

**Chat and composer.** Dropping a folder inserts its path instead of uploading
it. A hover preview shows what a collapsed paste chip contains. An abandoned CJK
composition no longer disables Enter until reload, and the side-panel composer is
IME-safe too. Scrolling up through a long history stops skipping messages.
Auto-scroll survives a content shrink. Tool rows animate in and out rather than
teleporting the transcript, and a tool's elapsed timer survives navigating away.
Queued-message controls are visible on light themes, and "run this next" promotes
the card you clicked. A long session title stops pushing the header controls off
screen. Closing the find bar returns focus to the composer. Bold-wrapped links,
and URLs followed by CJK punctuation, render correctly.

**Sessions and stopping.** Stopping a turn stops the session it is actually
running on. A stalled subagent card reports how long it has been idle. A channel
conversation keeps its thread identity when compaction fails or a context
overflow recycles it. A resumed session keeps its pooled MCP servers. A mid-turn
reset can no longer leave two turns interleaved in one session.

**Apps and settings.** Editing agent config in the dashboard no longer breaks the
agent until restart, and an agent spec Kiro CLI rejects is reported instead of
silently degraded. The settings tab strip shows scroll cues and scrolls the active
tab into view. Deep links highlight the right control in every language. An app
installed from a path or from git reports honestly, runs its MCP server on its own
interpreter, and starts its crons on `kirocrew app enable` without a restart. The
skill browser serves the skill you asked for rather than another of the same leaf
name. A folder knowledge source added from the dashboard can now actually be
started. Speech-to-text settings stop offering to install Whisper on a machine
that cannot run it. Notes render markdown tables, follow the active theme, and
remember collapsed folders. Dev Fleet discovers your clone instead of assuming
`~/kirocrew`, reattaches to an in-flight Pull and Build, and can force-remove kept
worktrees.

**Channels and notifications.** A Teams answer is no longer silently truncated
when a send is rate-limited. Slack works in private channels out of the box (the
shipped manifest requests the scopes), surfaces a permission problem instead of
delivering nothing, judges an OPTIONS click against the right turn, evicts the
prior owner when a thread is relinked, and reports its real connect state on the
System page. WeCom recognises a command after the mandatory mention. Discord keeps
a code fence open across message rotation. Notifications deep-link to the item,
stay dismissed when a stale fetch resolves, clear across every open window, and
retire themselves when the skill they refer to is handled.

**Desktop, install, and CLI.** `kirocrew stop` and `restart` find a macOS
framework Python. Ctrl+C exits `kirocrew chat` cleanly. Ctrl+Cmd+F toggles full
screen instead of opening the find bar. The macOS tray icon follows the menu bar's
theme. A failed update's card survives a reload. The installer's probe cannot hang
forever. `kirocrew` commands start up to about 0.8 s faster. A remote instance's
token-mint timeout is configurable for a slow network. A proxy-only host gets its
proxy variables forwarded to the identity check, and a slow SSO refresh no longer
parks you at the first-run gate. The frontend builds against a private npm
registry.

**Security and resources.** `agent.dangerously_skip_permissions` no longer treats
any non-empty string as true, so a `"false"` in config cannot silently grant
blanket approval. MCP gateway daemons no longer leak when their launcher dies.
Computer use costs no backend process on a chat that never uses it. Folder-write
audit lines name the component that made the write.

**Everywhere else.** Every major panel collapses to a usable single pane at phone
width, and the software keyboard no longer covers the composer. History search
works in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Session storage loads in seconds and
deletes in bulk. Theme packs report the CSS rules that were dropped and why, and
their declared fonts now actually apply. The Online badge means "tools usable" and
says when it was last checked, and Apply & Restart really mounts a newly installed
server. Doctor warns about missing swap, gives an honest sandbox verdict, points at
the thread that is genuinely stuck, and diagnoses an enterprise registry that has
silently removed the managed tools.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-09

The first feature release after launch: a real browser for the agent, four new
built-in apps, a native Windows desktop build, Korean and Japanese interfaces,
setup that no longer assumes Slack, and several hundred fixes from the first
weeks in the open.

### The agent gets a browser

- **Persistent Browser Mode** — Flip one switch in Settings and the agent can
  operate a real browser: navigate, click, type, and fill forms, with the live
  view streaming into the dashboard's Browser panel. Installation happens for
  you and recovers on its own — enabling it never errors out — and the agent can
  also serve browser work from the native embedded view.

### Eight new built-in apps

- **Spec Builder** — a spec-driven development surface: shape requirements into
  a spec, then hand it to the agent to implement.
- **Ops Mission Control** — an autonomous ops first responder with an incident
  board and a knowledge ledger of fix patterns.
- **Crew Companion** — a desk companion that reflects what your agent is doing.
- **Auto-Improvement** — measurement-first self-improvement that proposes,
  lands, and verifies its own changes GitHub-natively.
- **Meetings** — transcribes a live meeting, keeps structured notes and diagrams
  as it goes, and extracts action items you can review afterwards. Recordings
  and notes can now be deleted from the app.
- **Papyrus** — a LaTeX paper editor with a split-pane view, live PDF preview,
  and an AI co-author.
- **Mochi** — a desktop companion that lives on your screen in its own panel,
  watches pages and feeds for you, and plans its day around your schedule.
- **PPTX Maker** — describe the deck you want in chat and get a real `.pptx`
  back, by way of an agent that interviews you and writes a brief, an outline,
  and an art direction first.
- Every one of these is **opt-in**: install it from the App Store and enable it
  before it does anything.
- Installed apps are searchable and launchable from the command palette, and
  third-party apps now run under **per-app trust grants**, with a denial that
  tells you exactly what to do about it.
- **MCP Apps has its own switch** instead of riding the connection-pooling
  toggle, and the shared MCP gateway follows it.
- **Connections** gained a provider registry, so an integration declares what it
  is asking for and its consent URL is validated before you are sent to it.
- Pasting an OAuth return address for an approval that has already expired now
  says so, instead of blaming the paste — a spent approval is told apart from a
  failed delivery, so you know to start a fresh one rather than re-copy a dead
  address.
- Clicking **Connect** now asks for the provider's approval link instead of
  waiting for one, so the card offers it within seconds rather than only after
  some later chat happens to reach that server.
- Code Review Sage works against **GitHub Enterprise Server** hosts.
- An MCP server that authenticates with OAuth now receives the scope list and
  client id in the fields kiro-cli actually reads, so those connections
  authorize instead of silently failing.

### Windows, properly

- The desktop build moved to an **NSIS installer** with an integrated titlebar,
  launcher spawn/stop fixes, and a configurable sandbox tier for agent
  subprocesses. Skills, the usage ledger, and build tooling all learned the
  platform's rules.

### A dashboard you can operate

- **System is now a task manager** — live per-session resource usage, plus a
  **Storage** screen that reports what sessions cost on disk and reclaims space
  to a trash, with an inventory that no longer calls idle sessions "in use".
- **Releases tab** — this changelog, rendered per version in Settings.
- **Webhooks** — named tokens, HMAC signing, and a kill switch for inbound
  automation. The page is still being finished, so it now sits behind a
  per-device **Preview pages** toggle under Developer and is hidden by default.
- Redesigned sidebar folders, drag a session into an open chat to reference it,
  suggested folders for new sessions, consistent empty states with a next step,
  and a notification sound when an approval prompt needs you.
- **Continue instead of retyping** — resume an interrupted turn from where it
  stopped, on any idle session, and recover cleanly from tool-hook blocks and
  failed restores. Queued messages can be reordered before they send.
- The terminal panel pops out into its own window, completes subcommands and
  flags (not just paths), and takes a configurable font.
- **Agent Templates became a two-pane inspector**, and agents defined in the
  project you are working in are discovered alongside your user-level ones.
- **Send a copy of a session to another instance** — hand a conversation, with
  its context, to a different Kiro Crew you run.
- Jira issue URLs and setting references render as **link chips** you can click
  straight through.
- Stale auto-titles refresh in the background, the command palette tells a
  failed scoped search apart from an empty one, sidebar search keeps its
  relevance order, and the chat action footer grows to 40px targets on touch
  devices.
- Bold, italic, and strikethrough now render correctly in **CJK prose**.
- While the agent is waiting on something, the wait shows a **live countdown**
  with a button to end it early instead of leaving you guessing.

### Channels, and setup that no longer assumes Slack

- **`kirocrew setup` stops asking for Slack tokens.** The wizard finishes on the
  dashboard and points at the full set of chat channels; walk through the Slack
  credentials only when you ask for them with `kirocrew setup --slack`. Docs and
  in-app copy describe Kiro Crew as multi-channel rather than Slack-first.
- **Telegram** accepts inbound attachments — images for vision, documents, and
  audio that is transcribed on arrival. Serving **multiple bot accounts per
  gateway** was withdrawn before this release: a second bot is a second inbound
  door, and it is only worth having once a bot can be turned off, given its own
  security posture, and named honestly in the audit log on its own. A
  `telegram.accounts` entry written by an earlier release candidate is preserved
  in config but no longer starts a bot — move the token you want served to
  `telegram.bot_token`.
- A sub-agent's completion now reports back into **non-Slack** parent sessions,
  Discord continues the connected session when a reply arrives, and Slack
  renders an `OPTIONS` prompt as a real control everywhere it appears.

### Voice, language, and models

- **Korean and Japanese** join the dashboard — twelve interface languages.
- **On-device Apple speech-to-text** with live streaming; switch the microphone
  mid-recording; dictation lands at the cursor.
- The model picker shows each model's **credit multiplier** and scopes itself to
  what the account can actually use; background and sub-agent work take a
  **configurable per-role model** and reasoning effort.

### Autonomy with a governor

- Sub-agents can be steered with queued follow-ups, scoped to exactly the
  context a task needs, and report completions as cards in the chat.
- Monitoring loops accept a **wall-clock runtime budget**; cron jobs group into
  collapsible folders and start from a **template gallery** of 15 presets.
- Skills show their **per-injection context cost** on a budget screen, can opt
  out of injection, and the knowledge library adds documents automatically,
  dedupes per document, and honors `.kiroignore`.

### Diagnostics and trust

- **Report a Problem** collects a support bundle from the CLI or the UI, and
  every error message carries an "Ask the agent" hand-off.
- Loopback requests no longer leak the internal secret to a proxy; sensitive
  paths and credential redaction got faster without getting looser.
- The ACP runtime survives oversize output frames, worker sessions are no longer
  reaped as orphans, and `kirocrew update` works for wheel and `cli.sh` installs.
- A refusal from one of **your own** deny patterns can carry your note
  explaining it, and the seven always-on git-publish rules now render locked in
  Settings instead of offering a toggle that never took effect.
- The gateway **refuses to boot when its data home cannot persist state**,
  rather than running and losing your work silently.
- The tool-approval window and the watchdog's stall windows are both bounded by
  the turn ceiling, so neither outlives the turn it belongs to.

Plus roughly 280 further fixes across the dashboard, chat, the chat channels,
ACP transport, history consolidation, packaging, and CI.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-08-07

A hot patch for model entitlement: the model picker scopes itself to what the
account can use, a model the account cannot use is never sent, and an
unavailable model is reported as an access problem instead of a capacity error
or a raw JSON-RPC dump.
Initial kirocrew-customapi fork. Re-enabled the dormant `claude_code` provider (the `ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE` seam) so Kiro Crew can drive your own model router speaking the Anthropic API instead of Kiro's built-in Bedrock catalog.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-30

First public release of KiroCrew — an open-source personal AI agent that runs on
your own machine, driving [kiro-cli](https://kiro.dev) over the Agent Client
Protocol. Install it, sign in once, and it is yours: no server to rent, no
account to create, and your conversations, memory, and files stay on your disk.

### Chat from wherever you already are

- **One agent, ten ways in** — A web dashboard, a native desktop app, a terminal
  CLI (`kirocrew chat`, plus a full TUI), and bots for **Slack, Discord,
  Telegram, Microsoft Teams, Webex, WeCom (企业微信), and WeChat** all drive the
  same gateway with the same memory and the same tools. Start
  something at your desk, follow up from your phone. Each Slack thread or
  Discord DM is its own isolated session, and a dashboard session can be handed
  off to a Slack thread and stay in sync both ways.
- **A dashboard built for long sessions** — Multiple concurrent chats with
  auto-generated titles, live streaming tool status, and a context-usage ring.
  Edit and resend an earlier message, rewind a conversation to any point, fork a
  session into a new tab with its full context, or regenerate a reply and browse
  the variants. Organize with project folders, tags, Trello-style columns, and
  per-session colors; search across every session by content. 18 color themes,
  a Monaco code editor, `@filename` fuzzy file attach, and an incognito mode
  whose sessions never write to memory.
- **Speak and be spoken to** — Live streaming speech-to-text over WebSocket,
  voice memos transcribed on arrival, and local Piper text-to-speech for replies
  with no cloud round-trip.
- **Ten languages** — The interface ships in English, German, Spanish, French,
  Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Bengali, and Chinese.

### Work that continues while you are away

- **Unattended multi-step tasks** — Hand it a spec and it decomposes, executes,
  tests, and retries (`kirocrew run TASK.md`), designed for 10+ hour runs. It
  checkpoints to disk, so a crash or Ctrl+C resumes where it stopped; if
  kiro-cli dies it rebuilds the session and carries on; a watchdog catches
  stalls; and an LLM reviewer checks the result against the spec before calling
  it done. Failed steps become lessons it keeps.
- **Autopilot** — A per-session toggle that turns ordinary chat into
  plan-then-execute, with visible, editable plans, for when a request is bigger
  than one turn.
- **Cron scheduling** — Recurring jobs with per-job timezones, skip-dates for
  holidays, per-job timeouts, and jitter to spread load. Each job chooses
  whether it remembers the previous run. A job that finds a broken build at 3am
  can fix it and tell you over breakfast.
- **Parallel subagents** — Split one job across background agents
  (`kirocrew spawn run`), blocking or fire-and-forget, with progress visible in
  the chat header and completions delivered back into the conversation.
- **Dynamic workflows** — For work too structured for one agent, an authored
  Python script drives many agents through fan-out, pipelines, and
  judge-and-verify stages. An agent will usually write the script for you from a
  plain-English goal.
- **Proactive push** — The agent can pause mid-session to poll something, or
  register a webhook so an external system (CI, an alert, an inbox) wakes it up
  later.

### It remembers, and it learns

- **Memory that survives restarts** — Preferences, project context, and daily
  conversation history persist and are searched both by keyword and by meaning.
  Embeddings run **locally and in-process**, so nothing leaves your machine to
  make memory work. A graph explorer shows how memories relate.
- **Corrections stick** — Correct the agent once and it is kept as a lesson
  injected into every future session, so the same mistake does not return next
  week.
- **Knowledge Library** — Ingest your own documents and code into a searchable
  personal knowledge graph the agent can consult.
- **Snapshot and restore** — One command backs up config, memory, lessons,
  crons, skills, and history; restore all of it or just selected components,
  with a dry-run preview.

### Extend it

- **Apps, with six built in** — An App Store in the dashboard, an `app.json`
  manifest, TypeScript and Python SDKs, and gateway lifecycle hooks. Shipping in
  the box: **Auto Research** (multi-cycle research campaigns that keep going
  after you walk away), **Code Review Sage** (reviews each changed file of a PR
  in its own agent session), **Issue Radar** (GitHub/GitLab triage that
  remembers its notes), **Workflows**, **File Explorer**, and **Dev Fleet**.
- **Skills** — Plain markdown files that teach the agent a workflow, loaded
  automatically when a message matches or on demand when it decides it needs
  one. Twelve ship built in; write your own with no code and no rebuild.
- **Any MCP server** — Discover, probe, enable, and disable MCP servers from the
  dashboard. KiroCrew's own capabilities are exposed the same way, so the agent
  calls structured tools instead of shelling out.
- **Artifacts** — Documents, code files, and interactive widgets with a stable
  identity, version history, and a dashboard library. Deploy a webapp artifact
  to **your own** AWS account and get a public HTTPS link with a TTL.

### Drive your desktop, not just a browser tab

- **Computer use** — The agent can read a native application through the
  accessibility layer and operate it: take a window as a numbered outline of its
  buttons, fields, and rows, then press, type, set a value, scroll, or drag.
  This reaches work with no web UI — pulling a figure out of a spreadsheet,
  walking a desktop-only internal tool, reading an error dialog and telling you
  what it says. **Your mouse pointer never moves by accident**: actions are
  delivered to the target app, so a background window works without stealing
  your cursor or focus, and the one path that does take your real pointer has to
  be named explicitly by the model — the automatic choice never resolves onto it.
  **Off by default and macOS-only in this release**; enable it in Settings →
  Computer Use. Password fields are never read and a window holding one is never
  photographed, destructive-command-shaped text is refused rather than typed, and
  every call — allowed or refused — is written to the audit log.
- **Browser automation** — Playwright-driven navigation, form filling, and
  screenshots, including the ability to look at its own front-end changes and
  judge them.

### Security you can reason about

- **An OS sandbox you can switch on** — kiro-cli subprocesses can be confined by
  Linux namespaces or macOS Seatbelt, with three modes controlling which
  credential directories are even visible. This ships **opt-in**: the default
  (`agent.sandbox: "off"`) defers to whatever sandboxing kiro-cli applies itself,
  so set `agent.sandbox` to `"auto"` to have KiroCrew wrap the subprocess.
- **Layered controls** — 137 built-in denied-command patterns that hold even in
  YOLO mode, credential redaction scanning everything the model emits, blocked
  access to `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh`, XSS sanitization with CSP, and an audit log of
  every command.
- **A ceiling the agent cannot raise** — A two-level governance model
  (`POLICY ∩ PROFILE`, tightest-wins) enforced at KiroCrew's own tool gate. The
  policy files live where the agent can neither read nor write them, so a
  prompt-injected agent cannot widen its own limits. Tool calls are auto-approved
  by default (`agent.approval_mode: "auto"`) with the deny and governance gates
  still applied first — set it to `"interactive"` to be asked before each call.
  The dashboard is loopback-only and the Slack bot is locked to its owner.

### Run it your way

- **Install however suits you** — A signed and notarized universal macOS DMG, a
  Linux AppImage, a multi-arch Docker image for always-on servers, and a
  `pip`-installable wheel. The desktop app bundles its own Python, so end users
  need no toolchain. Runs on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**.
- **Three release channels** — **stable** is the default; **insider** gets
  release candidates a week or two early and is a switch away in Settings, since
  the two share one app and just follow different update lanes; **nightly**
  tracks the latest code and installs alongside your production app rather than
  replacing it, so you can run both. The desktop app updates itself, and nothing
  downloads or installs without you asking.
- **Always on** — Install as a systemd or launchd service, and manage several
  remote instances (dev boxes, EC2, a home server) from one hub over SSH.

### For app developers

- **`ctx.cron` mutators stay synchronous, with `*_async` siblings.** The App Kit
  surface (`add_job` / `remove_job` / `update_job` / `remove_all`) is
  synchronous, as published. Called from a genuinely loop-less context (CLI, MCP
  process, worker thread — what apps overwhelmingly use) they run inline as
  before. Called from a **running event loop** — an on-loop `on_startup` hook or
  route handler — they now raise `CronSyncOnLoopError` instead of parking the
  gateway loop for the cron-store lock window and stalling chat, timers, and
  heartbeats for every session. Migration is one line:
  `ctx.cron.add_job(...)` → `await ctx.cron.add_job_async(...)`, identical
  arguments and return value. The error is raised before any mutation, so a
  refused call never half-applies.

### Notes

- **kiro-cli is required** — KiroCrew orchestrates it. `kirocrew setup` walks you
  through installing and signing in; `kirocrew doctor` verifies the whole wiring.
- **Data lives in `~/.kiro/crew`** — override with `KIROCREW_HOME`. Installs
  using the earlier `~/.kirocrew` layout migrate automatically on first launch.
- **The dashboard defaults to `http://localhost:5476`** — override with
  `KIROCREW_PORT`.
- **Optional extras** — speech-to-text needs `pip install kirocrew[voice]`; the
  OS sandbox is POSIX-only; computer use is macOS-only in this release.
