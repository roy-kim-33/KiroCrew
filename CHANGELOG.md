# Changelog

All notable changes to KiroCrew are documented in this file.

## [0.5.2-roycrew.1] — 2026-08-31

**The provider picker now applies a backend switch immediately, and Claude
Code native no longer borrows the router's credential.**

- Switching the provider in Settings → Chat only set a local draft awaiting
  Save, so nothing reached the config and the next render read the old value
  straight back. The endpoint's switch side effects — provider-factory reload,
  live-session eviction, per-slot model clear — never ran either, so even a
  later Save could leave an open chat answering on the previous backend. The
  choice is now written on click, and the config refetch is awaited before the
  draft is dropped (dropping it first re-rendered the stale cache, which reads
  as the change reverting).
- Switching also reset the draft to an empty base URL, so a subsequent Save
  wrote `""` over a working router. The URL now carries across the switch.
- Claude Code native (no base URL) was still being handed
  `agent.provider_api_key` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. That key is a ROUTER
  credential; sent to Anthropic it failed every turn with 401 "API key is
  invalid". The config key is now gated on there being a router to send it to.
  An ambient `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still reaches the backend as before.

## [0.5.1-roycrew.1] — 2026-08-30

**Router model ids now follow the router, not a built-in table.** Three
failures against a live 9router install, all from assuming every router
behaves like CLIProxyAPI (raw ids, prefixes rejected). 9router is the mirror
image: it publishes `cx/gpt-5.5` and answers the stripped spelling with
`model_not_found`.

- An id the connected router advertised is sent upstream verbatim. The catalog
  is probed when the spawn environment is built — where the decision is
  actually made — rather than at session init, which happens too late to
  choose the spelling. Routers that advertise nothing keep the previous
  behaviour, so CLIProxyAPI is unaffected.
- `auto` resolves to the router's first advertised model. It previously
  resolved to nothing, so Claude Code fell back to its own default
  (`claude-opus-5[1m]`) — a Bedrock id no router serves — and every turn died.
- The picker lists what the router serves. A 94-entry built-in whitelist and
  an id map that rejected unrecognised models were between you and your own
  catalog; a live advertised list now wins outright, with the built-in list
  kept only as the cold-start fallback. `agent.model_whitelist` still narrows
  the list when you set one.
- Registered the `cc/` namespace, which 9router exposes once Anthropic
  credentials are present.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-21

The dashboard became a place to work on code rather than only talk about it: real
side-by-side diffs, an editable file tree, a transcript you can scroll back
forever, and a terminal and browser that dock where you want them. Underneath,
Kiro Crew got measurably lighter and stopped guessing about MCP — servers are
probed instead of assumed, and the panel tells you what is genuinely usable.
Windows joins macOS and Linux as a first-class target, down to driving native
desktop applications.

### Before you upgrade

- **The automatic move from `~/.kirocrew` to `~/.kiro/crew` is gone.** An install
  that never ran that migration must move its data home by hand before upgrading.
- **Updates follow Stable by default.** An Insider install that never recorded a
  channel preference moves to Stable; re-opt into Insider from About. This is what
  keeps a promoted release from drifting its users onto the prerelease lane.
- **The installer provisions Python with a pinned `uv`** instead of the
  apt/dnf/yum/mise ladder. Hosts that relied on system packages get a user-owned
  interpreter beside the data home; set `KIROCREW_PYTHON_DIR` to relocate it.
- **A self-frozen build is no longer supported.** Use the bundled-interpreter
  install or the wheel.
- **The git update lane is gated on how you installed, not just where you are.** A
  release install launched from inside a clone no longer updates by pulling that
  clone; use an editable install if you want that path.
- **The built-in browser is the default.** The browser tool drives the dashboard's
  own panel; turn it off in Settings → Browser if you depend on `playwright-cli`.
- **Board view is opt-in.** Enable it explicitly, or the layout shows as a list.
- **Creating a crew requires choosing an agent template.** A crew without one no
  longer creates.
- **An MCP server that declares its own `env` is pooled by default.** Set the
  env-forwarding option or an absolute command path to keep one unpooled.
- **Numeric settings are bounds-enforced, and several are now actually read.** The
  subagent memory floor and the per-kind session counts take effect where they were
  silently ignored — including a `0` you set to disable the memory gate — fractional
  container limits are refused, and out-of-range values are clamped. Re-check what
  you configured.
- **A path containing an unexpanded `$VAR` is denied, and an app token can no longer
  flip global auto-approve or resolve an approval.** Adjust any workflow that passed
  an unexpanded variable inside a path.
- **The skip-permissions setting must be a real boolean.** A quoted string no longer
  auto-approves every tool call, and no longer takes effect at all.
- **Publishing an artifact to a public URL needs an explicit acknowledgement**, and
  an operator can close the path entirely. If you had already narrowed the allowed
  destinations, add the AWS web deploy target to keep deploying.
- **"Run in terminal" sends the command to the terminal dock** instead of
  transferring it into the chat.
- **Private Slack channels need the app manifest re-imported.** Update or re-import
  the manifest, reinstall the app to the workspace, and copy the new bot token.
- **Explore is sourced from registries only.** Content that came from anywhere else
  no longer appears there; add it through a registry.
- **Nightly is no longer a one-click switch on the About page**, and **Apply &
  Restart has left the overview page** — use the per-server restart or Reload
  session instead.
- **Duplicate skill keys are removed.** An edition holding a stored reference to one
  of them must re-point it at the skill's canonical key.

### Work on code in the dashboard

- **Side-by-side diffs, inline editing, and a project file tree** — review and edit
  a change where you are already talking about it, instead of leaving for an editor.
- **The transcript scrolls back forever** — reaching the top loads older messages
  instead of stopping at the window the session opened with.
- **Reasoning streams as it happens** — the collapsed thinking row shows the model's
  reasoning live, one block per burst rather than a whole turn flattened into one,
  and the blocks survive a tab switch.
- **Pinned messages get their own side-panel tab** instead of stacking up in the
  conversation.
- **Click an inline code span to copy it.**
- **A command launcher** — an opt-in quick-search gesture opens a launcher whose
  rows say what kind of thing each one is.
- **Design Tweak** — click an element on a rendered page and edit it visually
  instead of describing the change you want.
- **A local Markdown link opens in the side panel** rather than failing.

### Sessions that keep up

- **Reload a session in place** — relaunch its agent to pick up new MCP servers or
  a config change without restarting the gateway or losing the conversation.
- **Search across every connected instance** from one box, and **find a chat by its
  PR, MR, or issue number**.
- **Filter the session list by tag**, and give a session **any colour you like**
  rather than one of seven.
- **Search inside a folder tab recursively** — nested files are found, not just the
  folder's top level.
- **The model footer says when "auto" chose** — you can see which model actually
  served the turn and that it was picked for you.
- **Crew Mode is labelled experimental** in the create menu, so its stability is
  clear before you pick it.
- **The summary panel bounds its height** and keeps more history within raised
  limits, and the session-pulse survey is back with consent and scope safeguards.
- **The "+N" source-link chip expands**, so you can open every linked source.

### Reach it from more places

- **Computer use on Windows** — drive native Windows desktop applications through
  the accessibility layer, not only macOS.
- **Windows publishes on the Stable channel** with its updater enabled, and a
  spawned agent tree is bounded by a real resource ceiling there.
- **Native `.deb` and `.rpm` packages**, each with its own update lane.
- **Import from Gemini CLI and Antigravity** during first-run setup.
- **Switch Kiro accounts from the CLI**, and **open the dashboard login from
  Telegram** for signing in on a phone.
- **The installer remembers your managed-Python choice**, and Doctor now warns when
  a source checkout is stale or on the wrong branch.
- **A managed deployment can supply its own update provider**, pointing self-update
  at an internal source.

### MCP and tools stop guessing

- **Measure every MCP server's shareability on purpose** — one labelled action that
  names how much is left and runs the whole fleet as a background pass, instead of
  an icon that quietly did two at a time. The probe now compares tool lists as well
  as capabilities, and records the version a server reported, so a
  `@latest`-style launch that changes upstream is re-measured rather than trusted.
- **A server that would degrade is no longer silently downgraded** — opted-in
  servers stop falling back to an unpooled backend behind your back, and the warning
  names the fix.
- **The Online badge means the tools are usable**, and says when it was checked,
  instead of presenting a stale reading as current.
- **Apply & Restart actually mounts a newly installed server** — and says so
  honestly when it could not, rather than skipping the change or reporting success.
- **Two servers can expose the same tool name** — the collision resolves through
  registry aliases instead of one of them losing.
- **A server that declares its own PATH keeps the inherited one too**, and every
  configuration surface expands it the same way, so a server can no longer work
  under one consumer and fail under another.
- **A guided five-whys mode** drives structured root-cause research step by step.
- **Choose whether the browser tool drives the native panel** or falls back to
  `playwright-cli`.

### Autonomy with a ceiling

- **Concurrent subagents share one memory and process ceiling**, so many small
  spawns can no longer add up past what the host has.
- **A monitoring loop stops itself when it stops making progress** instead of
  running to its cycle cap.
- **Hooks match by regex or substring** and can inject a skill declaratively, and a
  Stop hook that blocks now continues the turn with its feedback instead of halting.
- **Toggle auto-approve for the task runner from its compose panel**, without
  leaving the view.
- **The crew editor shows what wakes each crew.**

### Memory, knowledge, and secrets

- **An encrypted secrets vault** — store a credential where the agent is denied from
  reading it.
- **Scope a lesson to one repository**, so it applies only where it belongs.
- **Filter the knowledge graph by source** to look at one origin at a time.
- **A notebook can sync itself** on an interval you choose, in the background.
- **Read the memory layer from the command line**, not only the dashboard.
- **A lesson embedded by an older model is no longer deleted as a duplicate** or
  offered to you as a false contradiction.

### Apps and the store

- **Install what the official catalog lists**, each app pinned to a vetted commit.
- **A managed deployment can pin its own registry** and assign trust tiers to the
  apps it serves.
- **External registries appear in the store when the catalog is online** — a
  configured registry's apps were previously visible only offline.
- **Issue Radar** — edit an issue's assignees from the detail pane, and its
  Investigate, Review, summary and label agents write in your dashboard language.
- **Notes** — mermaid diagrams and images render in the preview, fenced code blocks
  are syntax-coloured, and headings follow a clearer ramp.
- **Channels, Dev Fleet, and Workflows each have their own icon.**

### Voice, terminal, and files

- **Local speech-to-text with Parakeet**, alongside the existing engines.
- **Choose the terminal's font** from a searchable list, and **stop voice read-back
  with Escape** instead of waiting it out.
- **A terminal dock for the whole app** receives "Run in terminal" output.
- **Spreadsheets open inline** with sheet tabs and headers, and **video and audio
  play inline** with seeking, instead of a download card or garbled binary.

### Security and governance

- **`kirocrew policy show` prints the 139 built-in denied-command rules**, grouped by
  category, so the agent can read what is blocked instead of discovering it by
  refusal.
- **A managed deployment can close external access** — the skill and MCP registries
  and cloud provisioning are no longer offered unconditionally.
- **An operator policy can declare a fallback looser than deny-all**, instead of
  being forced to block everything.
- **The skill auto-approve grant is visible and controllable** from the review panel
  and its notification.
- **The agents configuration directory is write-protected**, so an agent cannot
  plant an unsandboxed backend there.

### Faster and lighter

- **CLI startup: 1.3s and 112 MB of imports down to 0.5s and 54 MB** — about 0.8s
  and 58 MB saved for every MCP stdio server as well, which is per server, per
  session.
- **Computer use costs nothing when it is off** — no ~109 MB backend per chat when
  it is disabled or unsupported. One Linux host was carrying 16 of them, 1.75 GB.
- **The browser baseline installs Chromium only**, not every engine.
- **Chat turns no longer queue behind subagent cost sampling**, which moved off the
  main loop.
- **Leaks closed**: an orphaned MCP gateway daemon self-exits instead of staying
  resident at ~27 MB, removing a Dev Fleet worktree reclaims its ~0.6 GB pod home,
  and the one-time config migration stops littering backup files — one host had
  reached 72,327 of them.

### Notable fixes

**Chat transcript correctness** — Sending several messages quickly no longer
produces duplicate bubbles or strands a half-sent row, and switching sessions
cancels an in-flight history load so an old conversation cannot land in the one you
just opened. Steering mid-turn keeps reasoning above the answer, text that merely
looks like a tag renders as the characters you typed, the rename box stays attached
to the session you opened it on, and the composer reliably takes focus.

**Session list ordering and freshness** — The list ranks by when a conversation
actually settled rather than reshuffling on every streamed line, so a session you
are watching stays where you expect and a running turn stays near the top. Digit
shortcuts jump in the order the sidebar shows and hold that order while the modifier
is down, your open tabs no longer clutter the older-sessions list, and the
capabilities roster stops blinking empty while it refreshes. History also stops
serving a stale view after a rename, and duplicate saved messages and leftover
streamed fragments are cleaned up rather than accumulating.

**Staying up under stress** — A partial or malformed status update no longer takes
the dashboard down with it. MCP servers start even when a worker is still booting, a
backend that wedges on its first handshake is replaced instead of hanging forever,
and flipping one server's switch no longer rebuilds the entire broker. A slow probe
stops greying out the Continue button, a scheduled turn resumes after a transient
hiccup rather than stalling silently, ineffective auto-compaction backs off instead
of firing repeatedly, and orphaned agent processes are reaped even when their parent
was re-parented.

**Scheduling and background jobs** — A recurring job's next run is scheduled the
moment the previous one finishes instead of waiting for the next sweep, so it fires
on time rather than up to half a minute late. A command job clears its last result on
every exit path, one malformed stored entry no longer takes your other jobs down
with it, and in the jobs table the message column keeps its width while the actions
column stays pinned as you scroll.

**Security and credential handling** — A credential path can no longer be respelled
past the guard through a shell variable or a directory change, command boundaries
respect quoted and escaped separators so a disguised second command is caught, and
appending `--help` no longer runs a command without its approval prompt. A generated
skill cannot slip code past the validator, a file read cannot climb out of the
sandbox, and a busy temp directory or a stray thread no longer quietly turns
isolation off. A corrupted Slack configuration fails closed instead of reopening the
enterprise allowlist, changing one session's mode no longer revokes your
workspace-wide auto-approve grant, per-host integration tokens are stored on a
hardened path, the internal API credential is bound to the port it protects, and the
security panel distinguishes an unusable profile from a deliberate lockdown. A batch
of externally reported disclosure findings is closed.

**Windows, installs, and international input** — The desktop gateway recovers its
ports after a restart and the launcher survives the install being moved. A failed app
clone's partial checkout is actually removed, Windows absolute paths are accepted
where they used to be rejected, renaming agent configuration retries through a
file-sharing conflict, and uninstalling reclaims the update cache. The app refuses to
launch from a half-extracted backend rather than starting broken, rebuilding an
environment relinks its interpreter, an update shows an installing overlay and resets
cleanly when aborted, and small macOS icons render instead of coming up blank.
Pressing Enter to choose a candidate while composing Chinese, Japanese, or Korean no
longer sends the message.

**Messaging and connectors** — Markdown images survive into Slack instead of turning
into broken links, replies route to the correct thread, automatic thread titling
recovers instead of silently breaking, and Discord is told when a resumed session
loses its binding. A server name containing a colon is accepted, the pre-resolve
check no longer reports a false all-clear, content that should be shareable is not
wrongly refused, tools can reach a gateway on a non-default port, and "auto" falls
back to a model that works on GovCloud.

**Interface polish and accessibility** — The keyboard focus ring is back and appears
only when you are actually navigating by keyboard, the notification badge is no
longer clipped, and notification text stays legible over a busy background. Meter
numbers stay readable against their bar, project and activity lists hold a stable
newest-first order when timestamps tie so rows stop shuffling, sidebar labels show
the right relative day, and a long subagent digest stays inside its card. Animations
that were silently dead now play, a destructive button shows its colour on a touch
device and an armed Delete explains itself, the paste preview is reachable by
keyboard and screen reader, and builtin app pages start their content at the same
distance from a phone edge as the core pages do.

**Clearer messages when something goes wrong** — A denied file send gives the real
reason, a rejected connection names the setting to fix, and a session that stalls on
startup names which servers reported, which failed and why, and which are waiting for
authorization. A rejected credential is reported as an authentication failure rather
than a backend outage, switching accounts mid-session offers a way out instead of a
raw token error, a failed subagent keeps its error type and request id, background
cleanup that fails surfaces a warning and a count, and a subagent result is reported
with a path you can open. The Publish panel reports what actually happened, the top
bar tells a warming-up credit balance apart from one that failed to load, and an
over-long question refusal quotes a limit that is true for the script you are
writing in.

## [0.2.0-customapi.5] — 2026-08-08

**Big feature: native vision — image models feel first-class, not bolted on.**

![Vision tool — describe any image on a text-only model](assets/vision-tool.png)

Every model now reports `supports_vision`; the picker groups **Vision — image input** (muted **Image** pill) above **Text**, and **Settings → Chat → Vision** governs how text-only models handle images (describe subagent / switch / off + fallback model). Attach any image via the composer's `+` / drag-drop — it rides as native pixels on vision models, or as a one-shot `vision_subagent_describe` on text-only ones (the `vision_analyze` MCP tool is also available to the agent). Images are downscaled to model limits before they ever reach the gateway.

### Added

- **`vision_analyze` MCP tool** — the main agent can describe any local path or http(s) image URL on demand (`vision_analyze({ path|url })`), so screenshots the agent itself captures enter the conversation as text.
- **Vision-aware image routing** — `prompt_blocks` downscales + `vision.decide_image_input_mode` routes `auto` → native vs text; `AcpClient` + shared-runtime `AcpSessionHandle` both honor it so Slack/cron/dashboard share one implementation. Two new config keys surface in `config.json` (`agent.image_input_mode: auto|native|text`, `agent.image_redirect: subagent|switch|off`) and the new Settings card.
- **Reported `supports_vision` flag** — every `GET /api/models` row carries it (registry `supports_vision` + router catalog `capabilities` + ACP `oc/ol deepseek-v4-flash` denylist), wired `AcpAdapter` → `ModelDropdownList` grouping.
- **Multi-provider picker — full catalogs** — `oc/` (opencode-go) and `ol/` (ollama) now expose their full catalogs (mimo-v2.5, glm, kimi, minimax, qwen, gemma, …), with 9router `ocg`/`ollama` normalization so `oc/mimo-v2.5`, `ol/glm-5.2` etc. are selectable end-to-end.
- **Settings → Chat → Vision** — native `Image input mode`, `On text-only models`, and `Vision fallback model` selects, right next to Default Model. The model picker's Vision grouping is derived from the reported flag, not a hard-coded client list.

### Fixed

- AppImage gateway startup blockers (packaged-build path) and shared-runtime image prompt parity.

## [0.2.0-customapi.4] — 2026-08-08

The kirocrew-customapi fork: Kiro Crew with the Claude Code ACP backend re-enabled for self-hosted LLM routers (9router, CLIProxyAPI, OpenCode Zen, Ollama Cloud, and any Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

### Fixed

- **Endless loading in chat (OpenCode backend)** — the OpenCode ACP process now runs in an isolated `HOME`, so user-installed plugins (Honcho) and MCP servers can no longer stall the session.
- **Ollama Cloud 405/Unauthorized** — Ollama Cloud's Anthropic endpoint rejects cloud API keys; the wire format is now forced to OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`) which accepts the same keys and models.
- **Provider preset reset to "custom"** — the preset now derives from the saved URL, so it stays selected after save + reload.
- **"connection failed: undefined" on Test** — the provider test now uses the stored API key when no draft key is entered.
- **Stale model from old provider** — switching provider clears the default model and model whitelist, so old ids (e.g. `deepseek-v4-flash:0731`, `oc/mimo`) no longer leak into the new provider's picker.
- **Router-prefixed models in kiro-native** — `cx/`, `oc/`, `ol/` prefixed models are cleared on provider switch and no longer appear in the kiro-native model list.

### Added

- **Provider binary warnings** — Settings > Chat now warns when the selected backend's binary (OpenCode CLI or claude-agent-acp) is not installed.
- **New provider presets** — Ollama Cloud (OpenAI wire), OpenCode Zen/Go, commandcode.ai, 9router, CLIProxyAPI, OmniRouter, Anthropic, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Together, OpenAI, Groq.

### Verified

- 767 Python tests + frontend tests pass.
- Live AppImage chat returns instantly.
- All 14 provider URLs verified (200 or auth-required).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-17

The agent gained its own browser and can now run several threads of your work at
once. Sessions explain themselves when you come back to them, the dashboard grew
a Git panel and a docking side panel, Linux ARM64 and Windows join the
first-class builds, and you can talk to it by holding a key.

### Before you upgrade

- **Node.js 22 is now the minimum** (24 LTS recommended). A Node 20 install is
  refused rather than failing partway through a frontend build.
- **Multi-account Telegram is withdrawn.** Only a single bot token is accepted;
  move the token you want served to `telegram.bot_token`. Existing config is
  still parsed and preserved, but nothing reads the account map.
- **`kirocrew logout` now revokes refresh tokens**, not just access tokens, so
  logging out actually ends the session everywhere.
- **The terminal no longer scans its output for credentials.** That scan was
  corrupting CJK text and emoji in the PTY stream, and it swallowed secrets you
  printed deliberately. Terminal output is now passed through untouched.
- **Knowledge auto-ingest is opt-in.** A fresh install ingests nothing, and
  spends nothing on extraction, until you switch it on.

### Run several threads at once

- **Crew Mode** — Send the next message without waiting for the last one. Topics
  are dispatched to parallel sub-sessions and answers arrive independently, so
  one chat advances several pieces of work at the same time.
- **Session summaries** — A side-panel tab says what each thread of a session was
  trying to do and where it landed, with anything still open hoisted to the top.
  Old sessions can be summarised on demand. Opt-in, with its token cost stated.
- **Sessions resume instantly** — An earlier chat loads in the background while
  you read it, so the first message sends immediately instead of waiting on a
  cold start, and switching back restores your reading position.
- **You can watch the context fill up** — The composer reports consumption as a
  percentage and a token count, and the turn-stats footer names the model that
  actually served the turn, which matters when you are running on Auto.
- **A wedged turn recovers itself** — A stuck tool, a dead process, or a frozen
  model call is detected and nudged back to life instead of hanging silently.
- **Pinned messages, and a session that admits it needs you** — Pin messages for
  reference; a session waiting on your answer says so instead of looking idle,
  and one running a monitoring loop stays under "In progress" between cycles.

### The agent gets its own browser

- **The Browser panel is the browser** — The agent drives the dashboard's own
  side panel directly: navigate, click, type, screenshot. Browsing happens where
  you are already looking, with no second window and no security prompt. The
  Playwright CLI remains for remote sessions and for a browser you are already
  logged into.
- **Nothing to install first** — Browsing no longer needs Node or npm on the
  machine. A private, verified copy is fetched for you, so a locked-down laptop
  is one click from a working browser rather than a dead end.
- **Computer Use is offered only where it works** — Native desktop automation
  appears on macOS, instead of everywhere and then failing.

### New surfaces in the dashboard

- **A Git panel** — Repository status and commit log in the side panel, opening
  automatically alongside the folder tab once a session has a project.
- **The side panel docks to the bottom** — As well as the right, toggled from the
  panel header, which suits a tall or narrow monitor.
- **Issue links become chips** — GitHub, GitLab, and Jira issue, PR, and MR URLs
  render inline as icon plus `owner/repo#N`, and a Jira link shows the issue's
  details in the side panel instead of sending you away.
- **Feature Previews has its own page** — Preview opt-ins moved out of Developer
  → Config into per-feature cards, and Webhooks moved into Settings rather than
  holding a top-level nav slot.
- **A redesigned session list** — Tighter rows with a colour bar, a status gutter
  and a meta line, so session state is scannable; folders can be dragged onto
  each other to nest them in board view.
- **Crew members keep an activity log** — Each member of a crew gets its own
  space with a persistent log of what it has been doing.
- **Link previews, and previews that explain themselves** — URL unfurls now work
  in your own messages as well as the agent's, and previewing the dashboard's own
  address explains the loop instead of rendering a blank frame.

### Faster

- **The first message no longer stalls** — Embedding thread pinning cuts the
  opening turn's latency from roughly 7.4 seconds to about 350 milliseconds.
- **A cold dashboard load moves a quarter of the bytes** — Pre-compressed assets
  take it from 7.8 MB to 1.85 MB, which is what a remote or tunnelled dashboard
  feels most.
- **Dictation is about twice as fast** on a many-core host, and no longer spikes
  to thirty seconds under load.
- **Streaming is smoother** — Block parsing is throttled during a stream, so a
  long reply no longer builds quadratic pressure as it renders.

### Two new apps, and a store worth browsing

- **Personal Shopper** — Researches real stores on your behalf and recommends
  something only when buying actually helps. It diagnoses the problem first, and
  never touches a cart.
- **Issue Radar Crews** — Put autonomous workers on claimed issues. Each crew
  takes an issue into its own worktree, posts progress to a public claim ledger,
  and pushes a pull request: hands-free from triage to code review.
- **A curated App Store** — Discover renders editorial spotlights, themed
  collections, and category rails with curator artwork, not one flat list.
- **Meetings keeps the transcript** — Stored and shown beside the agent's notes,
  and it survives a reload.
- **Ask Code Review Sage why** — The reviewer stays available after it posts, so
  you can question a finding instead of starting over.
- **Research Lab and Spec Builder pick their own model** — Instead of always
  falling through to your chat default.
- **A public deploy asks first** — Publishing an artifact publicly requires an
  explicit acknowledgement, and an operator can close the path entirely.

### Reach it from anywhere

- **Linux ARM64** — A native aarch64 desktop build, published with an
  architecture check so nobody downloads the wrong one.
- **Windows is a first-class build** — The same targets as macOS and Linux, with
  its own install guide.
- **Summon it from any app** — A system-wide hotkey (Cmd+Shift+K on macOS,
  Alt+Shift+K elsewhere) raises the dashboard. Reconfigurable, or off.
- **Change release channel without reinstalling** — Move between Stable, Insider,
  and Nightly from About, and the gateway restarts in place after an update.
- **Publish it on your tailnet** — `kirocrew tailnet up` puts the dashboard on
  your Tailscale network, reachable from your other devices.
- **Launch a cloud crew from the dashboard** — Remote EC2 provisioning, device
  sign-in included, as a restartable job rather than a CLI session you must not
  close, and `--subnet` pins it into a private subnet.
- **One title bar on GNOME** — On desktops that draw their own decorations the
  duplicate native title bar is gone; the dashboard header does the job.
- **Connect to a gateway you run elsewhere** — A Developer setting stops the
  desktop app from starting its own local one.
- **Keep on Top** — Pin the window above everything else, remembered across
  restarts.

### Voice, terminal, and files

- **Push to talk** — Hold a key to dictate, or tap to latch it on. The key, the
  mode, and a live test strip are in Settings.
- **The terminal docks where you want it** — Bottom or right, opening in the
  session's own project directory, with your preferred shell.
- **Images are kept as artifacts** — Screenshots and diagrams the agent produces
  are preserved with a gallery, a detail page, and metadata.
- **Reveal a file on disk** — Jump from the file viewer to its folder, named for
  the file manager your platform actually has.
- **Mermaid diagrams enlarge** — Click one for a lightbox instead of squinting at
  inline width.

### Channels

- **Dashboard replies mirror back** — An answer you send from the dashboard is
  relayed into the Discord or Telegram conversation it came from.
- **Telegram has a real command menu** — Type `/` for autocomplete, switch models
  with inline buttons, toggle auto-approve, and see markdown tables render as
  tables rather than raw pipes.
- **WeChat accepts attachments** — Photos, voice memos, and documents reach the
  agent instead of being dropped.
- **A channel can file its own sessions** — Point a channel at a named sidebar
  folder and its conversations group themselves there.
- **Too many choices degrade gracefully** — An option list past a platform's cap
  becomes a numbered text list instead of silently losing the extra choices.

### Tools and connections

- **Connecting takes one click** — Connect mints the provider's approval link
  immediately and consent finishes on the card, instead of waiting for a later
  chat to trigger the challenge.
- **Pooling works itself out** — Kiro Crew probes which MCP servers can safely
  share a process. A per-server choice replaces the old global switch and its
  guesswork.
- **Per-agent tool sets** — Assign servers to particular agents so each sees its
  own surface without editing global config, and the agent picker offers the
  project-local agents found in the active session.
- **Tune how tools defer** — Decide how aggressively Tool Search hides tools
  until they are needed, trading context for immediacy.
- **Authenticated custom servers** — Supply request headers when adding a remote
  MCP server, instead of hand-editing a file.
- **`kirocrew policy show` lists the denied-command catalog**, so you can read
  what is blocked without going to the source.

### Autonomy with a governor

- **It knows when the machine is full** — Scheduled jobs defer and new subagents
  are refused when memory is critically low, and the header shows the posture so
  you know before heavy work fails.
- **Each job sets its own time budget** — Up to 24 hours, replacing one fixed
  thirty-minute cap, and a job's instructions can run to 50,000 characters.
- **Read a script job without a terminal** — Its Python source is shown,
  highlighted and read-only, in the job's detail view.
- **Monitoring keeps its schedule** — Talking to a session mid-loop no longer
  restarts the countdown, so checks land when they were meant to.
- **A blip is not a failure** — Transient throttles and server errors retry
  instead of counting toward auto-pause, a success resets the failure count, and
  an unattended loop that loses tool approval says so instead of dying quietly.
- **Subagents ask for permission like the main agent** — A subagent's approval
  request now goes through trust, auto-approve, or a prompt, instead of being
  dropped and leaving the child wedged.

### Memory and knowledge

- **Lessons surface by relevance** — Applicable older corrections stop decaying
  out of context as the library grows, and a lesson keeps its "not this" clause
  as a field of its own.
- **Knowledge spending is bounded** — A sweep budget, per-source rate limits and
  caps, a configurable extraction model, visible per-source cost, the files it
  failed on, and JSON Lines, NDJSON and Org Mode among the formats it accepts.
- **A tidier artifact library** — Sortable columns that remember their order, a
  copy-content button, and a header that stays put while you scroll.
- **Your own skills survive an upgrade** — A skill you wrote whose name collides
  with a bundled one is no longer deleted on startup.

### Security and governance

- **An app sees only its own events** — Installed apps receive the event scopes
  their manifest declares, and can no longer observe your chats, your scheduled
  job results, or another app's activity.
- **Scheduled jobs are re-vetted every run** — Checked against current policy
  each time they fire rather than only when created, and a restored backup can no
  longer smuggle shell commands past the approval system.
- **The memory ceiling covers everything at once** — The cap applies to all
  concurrent agents together, so many small spawns can no longer exhaust the host
  between them.
- **Credentials are scrubbed on the live stream** — Redaction now covers
  real-time output as well as replayed history.
- **A pinned policy floor cannot be lowered locally** — On a governed host the
  policy wins over local configuration, including over the unsandboxed-exec
  opt-in.
- **Memory edits require a recognised session**, closing a path where a forged
  key could delete stored memory.
- **Bring your own identity provider** — Administrators can authorise their own
  OAuth providers by configuration, without waiting for a release.

### Notable fixes

For anyone who wants to know whether their particular annoyance is gone.

**Chat and composer.** Dropping a folder inserts its path instead of uploading
it. A hover preview shows what a collapsed paste chip contains. An abandoned CJK
composition no longer disables Enter until reload, and the side-panel composer is
IME-safe too. Scrolling up through a long history stops skipping messages.
Auto-scroll survives a content shrink. Tool rows animate in and out rather than
teleporting the transcript, and a tool's elapsed timer survives navigating away.
Queued-message controls are visible on light themes, and "run this next" promotes
the card you clicked. A long session title stops pushing the header controls off
screen. Closing the find bar returns focus to the composer. Bold-wrapped links,
and URLs followed by CJK punctuation, render correctly.

**Sessions and stopping.** Stopping a turn stops the session it is actually
running on. A stalled subagent card reports how long it has been idle. A channel
conversation keeps its thread identity when compaction fails or a context
overflow recycles it. A resumed session keeps its pooled MCP servers. A mid-turn
reset can no longer leave two turns interleaved in one session.

**Apps and settings.** Editing agent config in the dashboard no longer breaks the
agent until restart, and an agent spec Kiro CLI rejects is reported instead of
silently degraded. The settings tab strip shows scroll cues and scrolls the active
tab into view. Deep links highlight the right control in every language. An app
installed from a path or from git reports honestly, runs its MCP server on its own
interpreter, and starts its crons on `kirocrew app enable` without a restart. The
skill browser serves the skill you asked for rather than another of the same leaf
name. A folder knowledge source added from the dashboard can now actually be
started. Speech-to-text settings stop offering to install Whisper on a machine
that cannot run it. Notes render markdown tables, follow the active theme, and
remember collapsed folders. Dev Fleet discovers your clone instead of assuming
`~/kirocrew`, reattaches to an in-flight Pull and Build, and can force-remove kept
worktrees.

**Channels and notifications.** A Teams answer is no longer silently truncated
when a send is rate-limited. Slack works in private channels out of the box (the
shipped manifest requests the scopes), surfaces a permission problem instead of
delivering nothing, judges an OPTIONS click against the right turn, evicts the
prior owner when a thread is relinked, and reports its real connect state on the
System page. WeCom recognises a command after the mandatory mention. Discord keeps
a code fence open across message rotation. Notifications deep-link to the item,
stay dismissed when a stale fetch resolves, clear across every open window, and
retire themselves when the skill they refer to is handled.

**Desktop, install, and CLI.** `kirocrew stop` and `restart` find a macOS
framework Python. Ctrl+C exits `kirocrew chat` cleanly. Ctrl+Cmd+F toggles full
screen instead of opening the find bar. The macOS tray icon follows the menu bar's
theme. A failed update's card survives a reload. The installer's probe cannot hang
forever. `kirocrew` commands start up to about 0.8 s faster. A remote instance's
token-mint timeout is configurable for a slow network. A proxy-only host gets its
proxy variables forwarded to the identity check, and a slow SSO refresh no longer
parks you at the first-run gate. The frontend builds against a private npm
registry.

**Security and resources.** `agent.dangerously_skip_permissions` no longer treats
any non-empty string as true, so a `"false"` in config cannot silently grant
blanket approval. MCP gateway daemons no longer leak when their launcher dies.
Computer use costs no backend process on a chat that never uses it. Folder-write
audit lines name the component that made the write.

**Everywhere else.** Every major panel collapses to a usable single pane at phone
width, and the software keyboard no longer covers the composer. History search
works in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Session storage loads in seconds and
deletes in bulk. Theme packs report the CSS rules that were dropped and why, and
their declared fonts now actually apply. The Online badge means "tools usable" and
says when it was last checked, and Apply & Restart really mounts a newly installed
server. Doctor warns about missing swap, gives an honest sandbox verdict, points at
the thread that is genuinely stuck, and diagnoses an enterprise registry that has
silently removed the managed tools.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-09

The first feature release after launch: a real browser for the agent, four new
built-in apps, a native Windows desktop build, Korean and Japanese interfaces,
setup that no longer assumes Slack, and several hundred fixes from the first
weeks in the open.

### The agent gets a browser

- **Persistent Browser Mode** — Flip one switch in Settings and the agent can
  operate a real browser: navigate, click, type, and fill forms, with the live
  view streaming into the dashboard's Browser panel. Installation happens for
  you and recovers on its own — enabling it never errors out — and the agent can
  also serve browser work from the native embedded view.

### Eight new built-in apps

- **Spec Builder** — a spec-driven development surface: shape requirements into
  a spec, then hand it to the agent to implement.
- **Ops Mission Control** — an autonomous ops first responder with an incident
  board and a knowledge ledger of fix patterns.
- **Crew Companion** — a desk companion that reflects what your agent is doing.
- **Auto-Improvement** — measurement-first self-improvement that proposes,
  lands, and verifies its own changes GitHub-natively.
- **Meetings** — transcribes a live meeting, keeps structured notes and diagrams
  as it goes, and extracts action items you can review afterwards. Recordings
  and notes can now be deleted from the app.
- **Papyrus** — a LaTeX paper editor with a split-pane view, live PDF preview,
  and an AI co-author.
- **Mochi** — a desktop companion that lives on your screen in its own panel,
  watches pages and feeds for you, and plans its day around your schedule.
- **PPTX Maker** — describe the deck you want in chat and get a real `.pptx`
  back, by way of an agent that interviews you and writes a brief, an outline,
  and an art direction first.
- Every one of these is **opt-in**: install it from the App Store and enable it
  before it does anything.
- Installed apps are searchable and launchable from the command palette, and
  third-party apps now run under **per-app trust grants**, with a denial that
  tells you exactly what to do about it.
- **MCP Apps has its own switch** instead of riding the connection-pooling
  toggle, and the shared MCP gateway follows it.
- **Connections** gained a provider registry, so an integration declares what it
  is asking for and its consent URL is validated before you are sent to it.
- Pasting an OAuth return address for an approval that has already expired now
  says so, instead of blaming the paste — a spent approval is told apart from a
  failed delivery, so you know to start a fresh one rather than re-copy a dead
  address.
- Clicking **Connect** now asks for the provider's approval link instead of
  waiting for one, so the card offers it within seconds rather than only after
  some later chat happens to reach that server.
- Code Review Sage works against **GitHub Enterprise Server** hosts.
- An MCP server that authenticates with OAuth now receives the scope list and
  client id in the fields kiro-cli actually reads, so those connections
  authorize instead of silently failing.

### Windows, properly

- The desktop build moved to an **NSIS installer** with an integrated titlebar,
  launcher spawn/stop fixes, and a configurable sandbox tier for agent
  subprocesses. Skills, the usage ledger, and build tooling all learned the
  platform's rules.

### A dashboard you can operate

- **System is now a task manager** — live per-session resource usage, plus a
  **Storage** screen that reports what sessions cost on disk and reclaims space
  to a trash, with an inventory that no longer calls idle sessions "in use".
- **Releases tab** — this changelog, rendered per version in Settings.
- **Webhooks** — named tokens, HMAC signing, and a kill switch for inbound
  automation. The page is still being finished, so it now sits behind a
  per-device **Preview pages** toggle under Developer and is hidden by default.
- Redesigned sidebar folders, drag a session into an open chat to reference it,
  suggested folders for new sessions, consistent empty states with a next step,
  and a notification sound when an approval prompt needs you.
- **Continue instead of retyping** — resume an interrupted turn from where it
  stopped, on any idle session, and recover cleanly from tool-hook blocks and
  failed restores. Queued messages can be reordered before they send.
- The terminal panel pops out into its own window, completes subcommands and
  flags (not just paths), and takes a configurable font.
- **Agent Templates became a two-pane inspector**, and agents defined in the
  project you are working in are discovered alongside your user-level ones.
- **Send a copy of a session to another instance** — hand a conversation, with
  its context, to a different Kiro Crew you run.
- Jira issue URLs and setting references render as **link chips** you can click
  straight through.
- Stale auto-titles refresh in the background, the command palette tells a
  failed scoped search apart from an empty one, sidebar search keeps its
  relevance order, and the chat action footer grows to 40px targets on touch
  devices.
- Bold, italic, and strikethrough now render correctly in **CJK prose**.
- While the agent is waiting on something, the wait shows a **live countdown**
  with a button to end it early instead of leaving you guessing.

### Channels, and setup that no longer assumes Slack

- **`kirocrew setup` stops asking for Slack tokens.** The wizard finishes on the
  dashboard and points at the full set of chat channels; walk through the Slack
  credentials only when you ask for them with `kirocrew setup --slack`. Docs and
  in-app copy describe Kiro Crew as multi-channel rather than Slack-first.
- **Telegram** accepts inbound attachments — images for vision, documents, and
  audio that is transcribed on arrival. Serving **multiple bot accounts per
  gateway** was withdrawn before this release: a second bot is a second inbound
  door, and it is only worth having once a bot can be turned off, given its own
  security posture, and named honestly in the audit log on its own. A
  `telegram.accounts` entry written by an earlier release candidate is preserved
  in config but no longer starts a bot — move the token you want served to
  `telegram.bot_token`.
- A sub-agent's completion now reports back into **non-Slack** parent sessions,
  Discord continues the connected session when a reply arrives, and Slack
  renders an `OPTIONS` prompt as a real control everywhere it appears.

### Voice, language, and models

- **Korean and Japanese** join the dashboard — twelve interface languages.
- **On-device Apple speech-to-text** with live streaming; switch the microphone
  mid-recording; dictation lands at the cursor.
- The model picker shows each model's **credit multiplier** and scopes itself to
  what the account can actually use; background and sub-agent work take a
  **configurable per-role model** and reasoning effort.

### Autonomy with a governor

- Sub-agents can be steered with queued follow-ups, scoped to exactly the
  context a task needs, and report completions as cards in the chat.
- Monitoring loops accept a **wall-clock runtime budget**; cron jobs group into
  collapsible folders and start from a **template gallery** of 15 presets.
- Skills show their **per-injection context cost** on a budget screen, can opt
  out of injection, and the knowledge library adds documents automatically,
  dedupes per document, and honors `.kiroignore`.

### Diagnostics and trust

- **Report a Problem** collects a support bundle from the CLI or the UI, and
  every error message carries an "Ask the agent" hand-off.
- Loopback requests no longer leak the internal secret to a proxy; sensitive
  paths and credential redaction got faster without getting looser.
- The ACP runtime survives oversize output frames, worker sessions are no longer
  reaped as orphans, and `kirocrew update` works for wheel and `cli.sh` installs.
- A refusal from one of **your own** deny patterns can carry your note
  explaining it, and the seven always-on git-publish rules now render locked in
  Settings instead of offering a toggle that never took effect.
- The gateway **refuses to boot when its data home cannot persist state**,
  rather than running and losing your work silently.
- The tool-approval window and the watchdog's stall windows are both bounded by
  the turn ceiling, so neither outlives the turn it belongs to.

Plus roughly 280 further fixes across the dashboard, chat, the chat channels,
ACP transport, history consolidation, packaging, and CI.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-08-07

A hot patch for model entitlement: the model picker scopes itself to what the
account can use, a model the account cannot use is never sent, and an
unavailable model is reported as an access problem instead of a capacity error
or a raw JSON-RPC dump.

## [0.2.0-customapi.1] — 2026-08-06

Initial kirocrew-customapi fork. Re-enabled the dormant `claude_code` provider (the `ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE` seam) so Kiro Crew can drive your own model router speaking the Anthropic API instead of Kiro's built-in Bedrock catalog.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-30

First public release of KiroCrew — an open-source personal AI agent that runs on
your own machine, driving [kiro-cli](https://kiro.dev) over the Agent Client
Protocol. Install it, sign in once, and it is yours: no server to rent, no
account to create, and your conversations, memory, and files stay on your disk.

### Chat from wherever you already are

- **One agent, ten ways in** — A web dashboard, a native desktop app, a terminal
  CLI (`kirocrew chat`, plus a full TUI), and bots for **Slack, Discord,
  Telegram, Microsoft Teams, Webex, WeCom (企业微信), and WeChat** all drive the
  same gateway with the same memory and the same tools. Start
  something at your desk, follow up from your phone. Each Slack thread or
  Discord DM is its own isolated session, and a dashboard session can be handed
  off to a Slack thread and stay in sync both ways.
- **A dashboard built for long sessions** — Multiple concurrent chats with
  auto-generated titles, live streaming tool status, and a context-usage ring.
  Edit and resend an earlier message, rewind a conversation to any point, fork a
  session into a new tab with its full context, or regenerate a reply and browse
  the variants. Organize with project folders, tags, Trello-style columns, and
  per-session colors; search across every session by content. 18 color themes,
  a Monaco code editor, `@filename` fuzzy file attach, and an incognito mode
  whose sessions never write to memory.
- **Speak and be spoken to** — Live streaming speech-to-text over WebSocket,
  voice memos transcribed on arrival, and local Piper text-to-speech for replies
  with no cloud round-trip.
- **Ten languages** — The interface ships in English, German, Spanish, French,
  Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Bengali, and Chinese.

### Work that continues while you are away

- **Unattended multi-step tasks** — Hand it a spec and it decomposes, executes,
  tests, and retries (`kirocrew run TASK.md`), designed for 10+ hour runs. It
  checkpoints to disk, so a crash or Ctrl+C resumes where it stopped; if
  kiro-cli dies it rebuilds the session and carries on; a watchdog catches
  stalls; and an LLM reviewer checks the result against the spec before calling
  it done. Failed steps become lessons it keeps.
- **Autopilot** — A per-session toggle that turns ordinary chat into
  plan-then-execute, with visible, editable plans, for when a request is bigger
  than one turn.
- **Cron scheduling** — Recurring jobs with per-job timezones, skip-dates for
  holidays, per-job timeouts, and jitter to spread load. Each job chooses
  whether it remembers the previous run. A job that finds a broken build at 3am
  can fix it and tell you over breakfast.
- **Parallel subagents** — Split one job across background agents
  (`kirocrew spawn run`), blocking or fire-and-forget, with progress visible in
  the chat header and completions delivered back into the conversation.
- **Dynamic workflows** — For work too structured for one agent, an authored
  Python script drives many agents through fan-out, pipelines, and
  judge-and-verify stages. An agent will usually write the script for you from a
  plain-English goal.
- **Proactive push** — The agent can pause mid-session to poll something, or
  register a webhook so an external system (CI, an alert, an inbox) wakes it up
  later.

### It remembers, and it learns

- **Memory that survives restarts** — Preferences, project context, and daily
  conversation history persist and are searched both by keyword and by meaning.
  Embeddings run **locally and in-process**, so nothing leaves your machine to
  make memory work. A graph explorer shows how memories relate.
- **Corrections stick** — Correct the agent once and it is kept as a lesson
  injected into every future session, so the same mistake does not return next
  week.
- **Knowledge Library** — Ingest your own documents and code into a searchable
  personal knowledge graph the agent can consult.
- **Snapshot and restore** — One command backs up config, memory, lessons,
  crons, skills, and history; restore all of it or just selected components,
  with a dry-run preview.

### Extend it

- **Apps, with six built in** — An App Store in the dashboard, an `app.json`
  manifest, TypeScript and Python SDKs, and gateway lifecycle hooks. Shipping in
  the box: **Auto Research** (multi-cycle research campaigns that keep going
  after you walk away), **Code Review Sage** (reviews each changed file of a PR
  in its own agent session), **Issue Radar** (GitHub/GitLab triage that
  remembers its notes), **Workflows**, **File Explorer**, and **Dev Fleet**.
- **Skills** — Plain markdown files that teach the agent a workflow, loaded
  automatically when a message matches or on demand when it decides it needs
  one. Twelve ship built in; write your own with no code and no rebuild.
- **Any MCP server** — Discover, probe, enable, and disable MCP servers from the
  dashboard. KiroCrew's own capabilities are exposed the same way, so the agent
  calls structured tools instead of shelling out.
- **Artifacts** — Documents, code files, and interactive widgets with a stable
  identity, version history, and a dashboard library. Deploy a webapp artifact
  to **your own** AWS account and get a public HTTPS link with a TTL.

### Drive your desktop, not just a browser tab

- **Computer use** — The agent can read a native application through the
  accessibility layer and operate it: take a window as a numbered outline of its
  buttons, fields, and rows, then press, type, set a value, scroll, or drag.
  This reaches work with no web UI — pulling a figure out of a spreadsheet,
  walking a desktop-only internal tool, reading an error dialog and telling you
  what it says. **Your mouse pointer never moves by accident**: actions are
  delivered to the target app, so a background window works without stealing
  your cursor or focus, and the one path that does take your real pointer has to
  be named explicitly by the model — the automatic choice never resolves onto it.
  **Off by default and macOS-only in this release**; enable it in Settings →
  Computer Use. Password fields are never read and a window holding one is never
  photographed, destructive-command-shaped text is refused rather than typed, and
  every call — allowed or refused — is written to the audit log.
- **Browser automation** — Playwright-driven navigation, form filling, and
  screenshots, including the ability to look at its own front-end changes and
  judge them.

### Security you can reason about

- **An OS sandbox you can switch on** — kiro-cli subprocesses can be confined by
  Linux namespaces or macOS Seatbelt, with three modes controlling which
  credential directories are even visible. This ships **opt-in**: the default
  (`agent.sandbox: "off"`) defers to whatever sandboxing kiro-cli applies itself,
  so set `agent.sandbox` to `"auto"` to have KiroCrew wrap the subprocess.
- **Layered controls** — 137 built-in denied-command patterns that hold even in
  YOLO mode, credential redaction scanning everything the model emits, blocked
  access to `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh`, XSS sanitization with CSP, and an audit log of
  every command.
- **A ceiling the agent cannot raise** — A two-level governance model
  (`POLICY ∩ PROFILE`, tightest-wins) enforced at KiroCrew's own tool gate. The
  policy files live where the agent can neither read nor write them, so a
  prompt-injected agent cannot widen its own limits. Tool calls are auto-approved
  by default (`agent.approval_mode: "auto"`) with the deny and governance gates
  still applied first — set it to `"interactive"` to be asked before each call.
  The dashboard is loopback-only and the Slack bot is locked to its owner.

### Run it your way

- **Install however suits you** — A signed and notarized universal macOS DMG, a
  Linux AppImage, a multi-arch Docker image for always-on servers, and a
  `pip`-installable wheel. The desktop app bundles its own Python, so end users
  need no toolchain. Runs on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**.
- **Three release channels** — **stable** is the default; **insider** gets
  release candidates a week or two early and is a switch away in Settings, since
  the two share one app and just follow different update lanes; **nightly**
  tracks the latest code and installs alongside your production app rather than
  replacing it, so you can run both. The desktop app updates itself, and nothing
  downloads or installs without you asking.
- **Always on** — Install as a systemd or launchd service, and manage several
  remote instances (dev boxes, EC2, a home server) from one hub over SSH.

### For app developers

- **`ctx.cron` mutators stay synchronous, with `*_async` siblings.** The App Kit
  surface (`add_job` / `remove_job` / `update_job` / `remove_all`) is
  synchronous, as published. Called from a genuinely loop-less context (CLI, MCP
  process, worker thread — what apps overwhelmingly use) they run inline as
  before. Called from a **running event loop** — an on-loop `on_startup` hook or
  route handler — they now raise `CronSyncOnLoopError` instead of parking the
  gateway loop for the cron-store lock window and stalling chat, timers, and
  heartbeats for every session. Migration is one line:
  `ctx.cron.add_job(...)` → `await ctx.cron.add_job_async(...)`, identical
  arguments and return value. The error is raised before any mutation, so a
  refused call never half-applies.

### Notes

- **kiro-cli is required** — KiroCrew orchestrates it. `kirocrew setup` walks you
  through installing and signing in; `kirocrew doctor` verifies the whole wiring.
- **Data lives in `~/.kiro/crew`** — override with `KIROCREW_HOME`. Installs
  using the earlier `~/.kirocrew` layout migrate automatically on first launch.
- **The dashboard defaults to `http://localhost:5476`** — override with
  `KIROCREW_PORT`.
- **Optional extras** — speech-to-text needs `pip install kirocrew[voice]`; the
  OS sandbox is POSIX-only; computer use is macOS-only in this release.
