<!-- Fill in each section below. Omit a section only when it is genuinely not
     applicable, and say so (e.g. "N/A — ..."). Keep the diff and this
     description in sync: every claim here must be supported by the diff. -->

## Problem / Motivation

<!-- Bug fix: the concrete symptom — what is broken or missing, ideally what the
     user observes.
     New feature / enhancement: the gap, use case, or opportunity this addresses
     — what a user cannot do (or does awkwardly) today. -->

## Why it matters

<!-- Impact if this is left undone: for a fix, who is hit by the bug and how
     badly; for a feature, the user/business value it unlocks. -->

## What changed (motivation → approach → change)

<!-- A short chain of thought so the reader sees *why this is the right change*,
     not just what changed:
     - Bug fix: observed symptom → underlying root cause → the specific change
       that addresses that cause.
     - New feature / enhancement: goal → the approach/design you chose (and why,
       over the alternatives you considered) → what you actually built. -->

## Tests

<!-- Automated tests added/updated and the behavior each one locks in. -->

## Manual verification

<!-- Manual steps performed or still required where unit tests fall short
     (integration paths, UI, external services). State "N/A — unit coverage
     sufficient" only when genuinely true, with a one-line why. -->

## Screenshots / video

<!-- MANDATORY for any user-visible UI change (new/changed panels, components,
     layouts, themes); delete this section otherwise.

     - Show each affected surface in its meaningful variants (e.g. desktop vs
       browser, empty vs populated, light vs dark).
     - Prefer a short video/GIF when the change involves motion or a multi-step
       flow (animations, transitions, interactions) — a still image cannot
       prove those.
     - Commit media to the PR branch under a top-level, ephemeral, never-packaged
       dir `temp-screenshots/<feature>/` (never under docs/ or src/kiro_crew/**)
       and embed with commit-SHA-pinned URLs so they survive branch deletion on
       merge and periodic cleanup:
       ![alt](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/raw/<sha>/temp-screenshots/<feature>/<name>.png)
     - Put the two or three most telling shots inline; fold full-page context
       into a <details> block. -->

<!-- Link to relevant issues, e.g. Fixes #123 -->

## Pattern harvest

<!-- REQUIRED for fix/revert PRs (PR Hygiene checks that this section is
     present); delete this section otherwise. Every fixed defect is a chance
     to stop its whole class: say whether this one generalizes.

     One of:
       Rule candidate: <semgrep | lint | review-prompt | agents-md>
       Pattern: <one line, e.g. "sentinel return value used in boolean context">
     or:
       Not generalizable: <one line on why this defect is a one-off> -->
