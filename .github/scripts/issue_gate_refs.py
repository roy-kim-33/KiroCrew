"""Issue Gate: print the issue numbers a PR body DECLARES for one repository.

The gate (`.github/workflows/issue-gate.yml`) needs one answer from a PR body:
which issues of THIS repository does it declare it closes? That question
already has an in-tree answer -- the closing-reference grammar in
`prepare-pr/scripts/pr_status.py`, exported as `declared_issue_numbers()`,
which is what the local prepare-pr loop prints its `NOTICE:` from. This
script is the gate's adapter onto that one entry point, so the
same body gets the same answer from both surfaces; a grammar re-derived in
the workflow drifts from it (a different keyword set, a different mask).

What counts, by reference to pr_status.py's `declared_issue_numbers`: a line
that STARTS (three columns of indent at most, an optional bullet) with a
closing verb (`close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved`,
the issue auto-closes on merge) or a non-closing `Refs` / `Part of` (the issue
stays open: partial work), plus `#N`, `owner/repo#N` or a github.com issue
URL, after HTML comments, fenced blocks (unclosed ones through end of body)
and inline code spans are masked; every reference on that line is read, and
what follows is free, so `Fixes #123 (the Windows half)` counts. A `>`-quoted
line, a four-column code line, a reference buried mid-sentence and a bare `#N`
are not declarations. The gate asks which issue the work is FOR, not what
closes, which is why the non-closing verbs count here while pr_status.py's
NOTICE path (a different question: why did the HOST resolve no closure)
ignores them.

A URL target counts only on the github.com host; that rule lives in the
grammar itself (`_DECLARING_REF_RE`), not here. This script adds nothing to
the grammar: it loads it, feeds it the body, prints the numbers.

Usage:
    issue_gate_refs.py OWNER/REPO < body.md

Prints one issue number per line, ascending, for references that name
OWNER/REPO (an unqualified `#N` can only mean the PR's own repository). A
reference naming another repository is not printed: the gate checks labels on
this repository's issues only.

Exit 0 = grammar applied (an empty stdout is "no declaration", a verdict, not
an error); 3 = a reference carries a number the host could never have issued
(reported, never silently dropped: the author meant SOMETHING there); 4 = more
than MAX_DECLARED distinct issues declared -- each one costs the gate an API
read against the shared hourly token pool, so the set is capped and the excess
is a finding, not a read; 2 = the reference grammar could not be loaded.

The body is untrusted author input. It arrives on stdin and is only ever
regex-matched by the reference module; nothing here evaluates or executes it.
