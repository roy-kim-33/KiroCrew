"""Scan every open pull request for pr-readiness-sweep.yml, over GraphQL.

The sweep needs three facts per open pull request: its head SHA, the state and
timestamp of the "PR Readiness" commit status on that SHA, and the newest
completed / newest failure-class check-run on it. Read over REST that is one
`/statuses` call plus one or two `/check-runs` calls PER pull request -- about
1500-2500 requests per sweep at 500 open PRs, four sweeps an hour, on the
installation REST pool that every workflow in this repository shares. On
2026-09-15 that pool was exhausted: 36 `PR Readiness` runs and every AI review
lane failed closed, and this sweep's own log read `statuses lookup failed;
skipping` for pull request after pull request -- the backstop taken out by its
own cost, exactly when a frozen status could not be corrected by anything else.

GraphQL bills against a SEPARATE pool, and one query carries all three facts for
a page of pull requests. So the whole scan is a handful of requests and the
sweep no longer competes with the lanes it exists to unfreeze.

Page size starts at 25 and that number is measured, not chosen for tidiness:
asking for each pull request's `statusCheckRollup.contexts(first: 100)`
alongside the status, `first: 100` and `first: 50` both answered HTTP 504,
`first: 30` took 10s, and `first: 25` took 4s and was stable at roughly 10
rate-limit points per page.

Page cost is content-dependent, so a page that times out at 25 can time out at
25 on every sweep, and ending the walk there would leave every pull request
older than that page unscanned for good. A page that fails its three attempts
is therefore retried at the SAME cursor with a smaller size, halving 25 -> 12 ->
6 -> 3 -> 1. The three attempts at the original size rule out a transient, so
each smaller size is probed once. Once a size succeeds the walk continues from
that page's `endCursor` AT THAT SIZE for the rest of the sweep -- the size is
never grown back within a sweep, the next sweep starts at 25 again. That keeps
the request count bounded: each size is given up at most once per sweep, so the
fallback adds at most 15 failed requests (3 attempts at 25 plus 3 at each size
it later fails at, or one probe each when the whole cascade fails at once), and
in the worst case -- a sweep forced down to size 1 on its first page -- one
request per remaining open pull request. GraphQL charges points by the nodes
asked for (one point a call at least), not by the request, so the smaller
pages cost about the same budget spread over more, slower calls.

Output is one JSON object per line on stdout, one per open pull request:

    {"number": 123, "sha": "<oid>", "pr_updated_at": "<ISO8601>",
     "readiness": {"state": "pending", "updated_at": "<ISO8601>"} | null,
     "newest_completed_check_at": "<ISO8601>" | null,
     "newest_failed_check_at": "<ISO8601>" | null,
     "checks_complete": true,
     "checks_requested": true}

Two scopes (`--mode`). `full` is the walk described above: every open pull
request, rollup and all, 25 a page. `delivery` walks the same set on a LIGHT
page -- no rollup contexts, so 100 a page and a few seconds each -- and then
reads the rollup only for the pull requests that can be stale on check
evidence (`_is_candidate`), addressing those by number in aliased batches. A
pull request the delivery scan did not read evidence for is emitted with
`checks_requested: false`, which the workflow tells apart from evidence it asked
for and could not fully read (`checks_complete: false`): nothing is missing,
nothing is reported partial, and the classification decides it on the pull
request's own age or activity. Measured live: the heavy walk was 25 pages and
261 seconds at 625 open pull requests -- longer than the sweep's cadence; the
delivery scan read 117 candidates in 59.

A 200 body can carry `errors` next to usable `data`: GitHub nulls the one field
it could not resolve (one pull request's rollup timing out, say) and reports it
under `errors` with the field's path, and the rest of the page is intact. Such
a page is kept and its cursor followed. The pull requests the errors touched are
told apart by that path: one whose readiness status could not be read is LEFT
OUT of the output, because an emitted record with a null `readiness` would read
as "no verdict published" and re-fire that pull request on transient trouble;
one whose rollup could not be read is emitted with `checks_complete: false`, so
the evidence is marked partial rather than read as "no checks". Only a body
whose `data` lacks the connection being walked is a failed attempt.

Degradation is deliberate: when even a page of one pull request fails, the walk
ends with a `::warning::` (saying how many pull requests were emitted before
it) and exit 0, because a cursor is only obtainable from the page that failed.
The pull requests past it are simply not scanned this sweep and the next sweep
retries them -- the same trade the workflow's concurrency block already takes,
which is to run less completely rather than not at all. A stale verdict
survives 15 more minutes; a sweep that exits non-zero rescues nothing at all.

stdlib only: the workflow runs this straight off a sparse checkout with no
`pip install` step, and `gh` (already authenticated by `GH_TOKEN`) is the only
external command.
