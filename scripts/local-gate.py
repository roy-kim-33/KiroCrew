"""Change-scoped LOCAL test gate: run the tests a diff is related to, on both surfaces.

Why this exists
---------------
The iteration loop on this repo (review-fix rounds, babysit amends) used to run
the full backend suite -- 62,108 tests, roughly an hour, and with ``-n auto`` one
xdist worker per core -- for every change whose diff touched more than one
surface or any ``scripts/`` file. On a shared 48-core box that is 32 workers
owning the machine while every other session crawls, to produce a signal CI
produces anyway on ``refs/pull/<N>/merge``.

This gate never does that on its own. It runs the RELATED set on each surface,
computed by ``scripts/run_scoped_tests.py`` (the same module the ``gates[]`` in
the prepare-pr profile call one surface at a time), with a bounded worker count.
The full suite is CI's job.

Contract
--------
- Every changed file (committed since the merge-base, staged, unstaged or
  untracked) lands in exactly one of CI's buckets -- ``frontend``
  (``website/**``), ``meta`` (``.github/**``, ``scripts/**``), ``backend``
  (everything else) -- or, for ``temp-screenshots/**`` evidence, none. The
  buckets are pinned to ``ci.yml`` by ``test/test_local_gate.py``; they are
  reported, and they decide whether the cross-surface set joins the plan.
- For EACH surface the plan is that surface's related set: test files in the
  diff, ``test_<module>*.py`` / ``<Stem>.*.test.ts`` beside changed modules,
  tests that textually reference a changed file, and -- when the OTHER surface
  changed -- the cross-surface set ``ci-surface-tests.py`` computes for CI.
  A surface with nothing related is skipped and says so.
- There is NO automatic path to a full suite. Not for a meta change, not for a
  diff touching both surfaces, not for a large related set (its size is printed
  and it runs). ``--full`` exists for a human who asks for one.
- A diff the gate cannot read (git failure, unresolvable base, a selector target
  that could pass for an option) fails CLOSED: exit 2, run nothing, say why.
  The old fallback of "then run everything" is the behaviour this script exists
  to remove.

Usage
-----
    scripts/local-gate.py                  # diff against merge-base with origin/main
    scripts/local-gate.py --base REF       # explicit base ref
    scripts/local-gate.py --dry-run        # print the plan, run nothing
    scripts/local-gate.py --full           # both surfaces' FULL suites (human-requested)

Exit status is the gate's: 0 when every selected command passed (or nothing was
related), 2 when the diff could not be read, non-zero otherwise. ``--dry-run``
exits 0 after printing the plan. pytest runs as ``-n auto`` with
``PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS`` capped at ``min(max(cpu_count // 3, 2), 12)``,
so the root ``xdist_budget.py`` still applies its memory clamp and shared slots
under that cap; a human who wants the machine saturated runs a bare
``python -m pytest`` instead.
