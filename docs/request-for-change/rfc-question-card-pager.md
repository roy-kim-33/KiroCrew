# RFC: Question Card Pager — one question on screen, and answers that carry their question

- Status: accepted — buluoray's decision from the review of this document on 2026-09-24,
  which accepted the pager and deferred §7.1 to a follow-up.
- Author: tilakputta
- Created: 2026-09-24
- Related: `website/src/components/QuestionCard.tsx` (the card this reshapes),
  `website/src/components/PendingQuestionCard.tsx` (the submit path whose text format
  changes), `website/docs/i18n-catalog.md` (the authoring rule the six new keys follow)

## 1. Problem statement

`ask_question` can raise several questions in one card, and the multi-question case is
broken in three separate ways. Verified on main `61d5bb577`, re-read at `e88e80778`; the
cited symbols are unchanged between them.

**The answer loses its question.** `asText` in `PendingQuestionCard.tsx` is
`Object.values(answers).join('\n')`, and the `onSubmit` handler hands that string to
`onDirectSend` as the answer. Three questions therefore reach the agent as three bare
lines in map-iteration order, with no indication of which question each belongs to. A
multi-select answer is itself a joined string, so two selections on one question are
indistinguishable from two separate questions answered. The agent is left guessing, and a
stateless card commits that same string as the user's own chat message, so the transcript
is wrong too.

**Nothing distinguishes a multi-select from a single-select.** Both modes render the same
option rows through the same `toggleOption` handler with the same `aria-pressed` toggle. A
user answering a multi-select has no way to know more than one answer is accepted, and no
way to know the card is waiting rather than finished.

**A multi-select strands the user.** Single-select auto-advances on answer. Multi-select
deliberately does not, because one click does not finish it — so on a card whose Submit
is disabled until every question is answered, the only enabled primary control is absent
and the only way forward is the small corner chevron. Users stop there.

The first defect is the one that matters most, and it is small. The second and third are
small too. But fixing them exposes a fourth problem that is not small, and is the reason
this document exists: **the stacked card does not have room for the cues the fixes need.**

The card is an accordion. It carries three separate mechanisms to stay usable — a
per-question `collapsed` map seeded by `initialCollapsed`, a `toggleCollapsed` handler, and
a `max-h-[min(60vh,32rem)]` cap on the card with an inner `overflow-y-auto` scroll region —
plus a `Collapse all` / `Expand all` control driven by `allCollapsed` to manage the result.
Each of those exists to compensate for the same thing: N questions do not fit, so the card
must hide most of them and then offer controls for un-hiding. Adding a mode cue and a
forward affordance per question makes each row taller, which makes the compensation worse.

### 1.1 Before and after

![Two columns, before on main and after this change. Row one, the card: an accordion holding three questions with the third clipped and a Collapse all control, against one question with 1/3 and corner arrows. Row two, a multi-select: two options selected with only a border tint and a disabled Submit, against a checkbox on every option and an enabled Next. Row three, what the agent gets: three unlabelled lines of answer text, against three Q. slash A. pairs](assets/question-card-before-after.png)

Both sides are captures of the real built SPA, not mock-ups. The "before" column comes from
`main` at `61d5bb577` through `website/scripts/capture-question-card-compact.mjs`; the
"after" column from the implementation branch through its replacement,
`capture-question-card-pager.mjs`. Same fixture — three questions, four options each, the
middle one a multi-select — so the code under test is the only variable, and each row's two
panels are bottom-aligned so the footers compare directly.

Worth noting what is absent on the "before" side: `capture-question-card-compact.mjs` has no
multi-select in its fixture at all. The mode was invisible, so there was nothing to
photograph, and row two's "before" had to be captured for this document.

Reading the rows against §1's three defects: row three is the answer-format defect, where
`Unit tests for the changed module, Linter and type checks` is one multi-select answer that
reads as a single answer containing a comma. Row two is the invisible mode and the strand —
two options are picked and only a border tint says so, and since answering cannot finish the
question there is no enabled primary control. Row one is why the first two cannot be fixed
in place: the card is already hiding most of its content to fit.

## 2. Design principles

- **One question on screen is bounded by construction.** The accordion's three mechanisms
  all approximate a bound the pager gets for free.
- **One gesture per question on the common path.** A single-select answer should not also
  cost a Next.
- **The answer the agent receives must be unambiguous** without the agent knowing the
  order the questions were asked in.
- **A card is one atomic ask.** Partial submission is not a feature: the answer map is
  keyed by question text, and a map missing entries cannot be told apart from a map that
  was never asked for them.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Pager replaces the accordion

A multi-question card renders exactly one question, with an `N/M` position indicator and
`‹` `›` arrows in the header. `collapsed`, `toggleCollapsed`, the height cap and the
`Collapse all` / `Expand all` control are all removed, along with their
`components.questionCard.collapse_all`, `expand_all` and `not_answered_yet` catalog keys.
A single-question card renders no pager at all — no position, no arrows — because there is
nowhere to go.

### 3.2 Submit is positional, Next carries the walk

Every question except the last offers `Next`; the last offers `Submit`. Submit is disabled
until every question is answered, so the last page can hold a disabled Submit — but no page
holds a disabled Submit as its *only* primary control, which is the state a multi-select
put the user in.

Positional and not "Submit once complete": one card is one atomic ask, so Submit belongs at
the end of the walk and nowhere else. Answering out of order therefore costs a trip to the
last page, which the arrows make one click.

`Enter` in the custom-answer box advances rather than submitting, except on the last page.
Without that, Enter would resume the agent from a page whose visible primary action is
`Next` — answer Q2 by arrow, return to Q1, retype, press Enter. Advancing also carries
focus onto the next page's input, since the pages are keyed and the focused input unmounts
with its page; an arrow *click* deliberately does not move focus, so the fix cannot
overreach into pointer navigation.

### 3.3 Answers carry their question

`asText` emits one `Q. <question>` / `A. <answer>` pair per question, pairs separated by a
blank line, via a new `components.pendingQuestionCard.qa_pair` key. A single-question card
emits the bare answer with no label, because there is nothing to disambiguate and the
wrapper would only echo a question the user just read.

The `Q.` / `A.` initials are localized per catalog (`F./A.` de, `В./О.` ru, `問/答` ja …):
the string becomes the user's own chat bubble, so an English `Q.` in a Russian transcript
reads as a defect.

### 3.4 What is lost, and what replaces it

Off-screen questions are unmounted, so the folded rows' one remaining benefit goes with
them: a folded row carried its own answer, so the stacked card showed every answer at
Submit time.

Replaced by half of that: a footer line naming how many questions remain unanswered, which
jumps to the first of them — except when that question is the one already on screen, where
a jump would land where the user is standing, so it degrades to plain text.

So *which* questions still need attention stays visible; *what will be submitted* does not.
Checking the answers before Submit now means paging back with the arrows. This is a real
reduction and not a like-for-like swap. §7.1 holds the summary that would restore it,
deferred to a follow-up.

### 3.5 Use cases, and what each one does

Every row is the behaviour as designed, with the test that holds it. The point of the table
is that the design is checkable rather than persuasive: a reviewer who disagrees with a row
is disagreeing with something specific, and a future change that breaks a row breaks a
named test.

| Case | Behaviour | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|
| One question | No pager, no position, no arrows. Submit is the only primary control, and the submitted text is the bare answer with no `Q.`/`A.` wrapper | `offers no pager on a single question, where both arrows would be dead`; `offers Submit alone on a single-question card`; `does not auto-advance a single-question card` |
| Two or more questions | One question on screen, `N/M` in the corner, arrows to move; the arrows stop at both ends rather than wrapping | `shows one question at a time, with the position in the corner`; `walks forward and back through the questions`; `stops at both ends instead of wrapping` |
| A single-select is answered | Auto-advances to the next **unanswered** question, so the common path costs one gesture per question — and holds still when there is nowhere useful to go | `auto-advances to the next unanswered question on a single-select answer`; `holds still on the last answer rather than jumping somewhere arbitrary` |
| A multi-select is answered | Holds position, because one click does not finish it, and `Next` carries every pick forward | `does not auto-advance a multi-select, which is unfinished after one click`; `carries a multi-select forward on Next, keeping every pick` |
| An already-answered question is changed | Does not advance away: the user came back deliberately | `does not advance away when an already-answered question is changed`; `does not auto-advance on a deselect, where the user is still choosing` |
| Questions answered out of order | Permitted. Submit appears only on the last page, so completing out of order costs one arrow click to reach it | `withholds Submit before the last question even when every answer is in`; `submits answers picked across separate pages` |
| A question on screen is unanswered | `Next` is disabled; the corner arrows are not, since review is not progress | `keeps Next disabled until the question on screen is answered`; `leaves the corner arrows ungated, since review is not progress` |
| Some question elsewhere is unanswered | Submit is disabled and the footer names how many remain, jumping to the first — as plain text, not a jump, when that question is the one on screen | `names how many questions are unanswered and jumps to the first`; `states the count without offering a jump when the outstanding question is on screen`; `drops the unanswered notice once every question is answered` |
| Keyboard only | `Enter` in the custom box advances and carries focus onto the next page's input; it submits only on the last page, and cannot skip an unanswered question. An arrow *click* deliberately does not move focus | `advances on Enter in the custom box, and submits there on the last question`; `will not submit on Enter from a page that shows no Submit`; `does not let a stray Enter skip an unanswered question`; `carries focus onto the next page when Enter advances the walk`; `leaves focus alone when an arrow moves the page` |
| The same card is re-dispatched | In-progress answers survive; a genuinely different question set resets to the first question | `keeps in-progress answers when the same card is re-dispatched`; `resets when the prompt is reused with different options`; `starts a replaced question set back at the first question` |
| A **shorter** replacement set arrives while the user is on a later page | The page is clamped into range for every consumer of it — index, position, arrows, `isLast` — so the card re-renders rather than throwing and taking the dashboard with it | `survives a replacement question set shorter than the page it is on` |
| A non-English locale | Controls and the `Q.`/`A.` initials both come from the catalog, so no card and no transcript renders in English | `catalogParity.test.ts` |

## 4. Migration plan

No migration. The card is client-side and mounts per delivery; there is no persisted card
state, no stored preference for the accordion, and no API shape change — the
`question_card` websocket frame and `POST /api/ask-question/<id>/answer` are untouched. The
only wire-visible change is the text a stateless card submits (§3.3).

The three retired catalog keys are removed from all 12 catalogs in the same change, so no
locale renders a key that no longer exists and none renders the new controls in English.

## 5. Security model

Nothing security-relevant changes. The card neither gains nor loses a capability: it
renders options the agent supplied and sends back a string the user chose. The submitted
text is longer and now contains the question text, which the agent itself authored and
already had — so no new data crosses the boundary.

One adjacent property is worth stating because the pager makes it easier to get wrong: a
card is replaced in place per slot, so a shorter replacement question set arriving while the
user has walked into a later page would index past the end of the new array. That is a
crash, not a leak, and it is pinned by a no-throw test rather than left to the render-phase
reset.

## 6. Non-goals

- **A review step.** Not a wizard with a confirmation page; see §7.1.
- **Partial submission.** One card is one atomic ask (§2).
- **Reordering or skipping questions the agent asked.** The pager changes presentation
  order of arrival, not the set.
- **Anything about the single-question card.** It keeps its current shape, minus the
  now-pointless label wrapper.

## 7. Questions, and how they were answered

### 7.1 Restoring the pre-submit answer review — deferred

**Decided 2026-09-24 by buluoray: the pager is accepted, and restoring the answer review is
deferred to a follow-up. It does not block
[#13196](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/13196).**

The design's one real subtraction (§3.4). A compact answered-summary above Submit on the
last page would restore it without re-stacking the card: every answer visible, read-only,
on the page where Submit already lives. It is not part of this design because it
re-introduces a variable-height region on one page, and the smaller card is worth having on
its own first.

### 7.2 Whether `Enter` on the last page submits — open

§3.2 has it submit. The argument for requiring the button is that Enter's meaning then never
changes between pages; the argument against is that it costs the keyboard walk its last
step. Nothing else in §3 depends on which way this goes, so it can be settled on its own.

## 8. Alternatives considered

**Fix the three defects and keep the accordion.** The narrowest change, and it genuinely
works for the answer-format defect, which is why it is the alternative to beat: the fix in
§3.3 is independent of the pager and could ship alone. Rejected as the whole answer because
the mode cue and the forward affordance both need vertical room per question, and the
accordion is already compensating for not having it — three mechanisms plus a control, and
a fourth compensation would be needed for the taller rows. This RFC takes the position that
the compensation is the problem.

**Accordion with a tighter viewport cap.** Cheaper still, and it is what the card's
existing `max-h` cap already is. Rejected: the cap makes the card scroll internally inside
a chat column that also scrolls, and nesting those is what made the folded state necessary
in the first place.

**A wizard with an explicit review page.** Pager plus a final read-only summary page, which
would answer §7.1 outright. Rejected for now as more card than the common case deserves —
most `ask_question` calls carry one or two questions, and a mandatory extra page taxes all
of them to serve the rare four-question card. The §7.1 summary is the cheaper half of this.

**Keep Submit always visible, enabled once complete.** Rejected: it puts a disabled Submit
on every page as the only primary control, which is the multi-select strand this change
exists to fix, and it makes "where does the ask end" a function of state rather than
position.
