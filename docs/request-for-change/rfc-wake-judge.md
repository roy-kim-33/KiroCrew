# RFC: Wake judge — a System One model screens auto-nudge ticks

- Feature preview; default off
- Companion: [`rfc-conductor-work-ledger`](rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md) Phase 3
  (typed wake gate). The judge is the other half: it screens evidence only a
  model can read.

Status: partial. The LLM lane is on main: `decisions/impl_llm.py` answers the
judge's questions over one tool-less model call, `gate.py` carries `nudge.wake`
in `DECISION_POINT_NAMES` beside `JUDGE_POINT` and the two lane names, and
`decisions.nudge_wake.provider` and `.llm_model` are live config keys the config
route may edit. The judge core is on main as well, from
[#12787](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/12787) (merged `2d5a800ee`):
`decisions/points/nudge_wake.py`, the `nudge_evidence` entry in
`POINT_SCOPE_KEYS`, the evidence collectors, the autonudge tick hook, `judge` on
`monitor_start` / `monitor_update` and the transcript notice are all on the base
tree. What is still outstanding is the reader placement §8's PR G entry records,
and the skills
that author a brief. No `kirocrew-judge` agent
template is coming: the landed lane runs on the bundled `kirocrew-lite`
(`JUDGE_AGENT_NAME`), because a judge template would differ from it only in the
model, which the runner passes per call, and a standing prompt the call already
states. Code references below were read at `ccba8886cc`.

## 1. Problem

An auto-nudge loop (`monitor_start`) fires a full model turn on its owning
session every interval. A tick whose evidence is TYPED can already be made free:
a pull-request watch whose bar is a check conclusion returns quiet without
spending a turn. What costs a turn whether or not the evidence needs it is
everything a typed reading cannot settle — a conductor patrolling worker
transcripts, a babysitter reading bot comment bodies, a loop watching a log, and a
pull-request watch whose owner's bar is a sentence of their own rather than a
check conclusion. Measured on this
repository today: a conductor watching
three workers at 45 min spends ~48 turns over two days to act on about five
events; ten patrol loops died together on a gateway restart and nobody noticed
for hours because the only reader was the loop itself. A second measurement, from
this document's own review cycle: one patrol ran 9 cycles at 45 minutes across 5
workers, and roughly two thirds of those reads found nothing new.

The typed wake gate ([`rfc-conductor-work-ledger`](rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md)
§Wake gate, Phase 3) removes the turn for facts that arrive as typed fields
(item status, PR checks). It cannot read a transcript tail, a review comment, or
a log line. Those still need judgment, and today the only judge available is the
main session at full price.

## 2. Idea

Keep the loop. Keep the poll. On each tick, do not wake the main session; wake
a **judge** — a fast, cheap, typed decision — that reads the new evidence and
answers one question: does the owner need to act now? Only a yes fires the
main session. The judge is a decision point on the shipped `decisions` seam
(`src/kiro_crew/decisions/`, PR #11490 and successors), the same seam Joe used
for sampled skill selection (`skills.select`), risky-tool flags and model-tier
routing. Jev (TypeSafe's System One model: state + typed questions in,
calibrated probabilities out, ~100 ms, no strings, no hallucinated shapes) is
the intended judge. Where Jev is not consented, the same interface is served by
a text-only small model behind a strict parser, so the mechanism is one and the
provider is a setting.

Kahneman's split is the design: the judge is System One (a gut check in
milliseconds), the main session is System Two (slow, deliberate, expensive).
The judge never acts; it only decides whether System Two is needed.

## 3. Design

```

TERMINAL is not a judge verdict. The auto-nudge core ends a loop on one typed
fact it maps itself — a merged or closed pull request — and the judge can never
stop one, so no prose can buy permanent silence. The reader that supplies that
fact does not act on it either: it fetches, and the mapping lives in the core.

### 3.1 The decision point `nudge.wake`

State (one object, ≤ 8 000 chars after scrubbing). The shed rule: the typed
summaries `pr_state` and `pr_checks` are pinned, and when the budget binds the
oldest PROSE item goes. Pinned because the built-in criteria are answered from
them, so shedding them would delete the evidence the question is asked against,
and because they are bounded and small -- one `pr_checks` item renders a 90-lane
board in 42 characters -- so they are never the pressure on the budget. Oldest
prose because a comment body is as old as its comment, while a summary is observed
on the tick that sends it:

- `loop`: the owner's instruction, truncated to 1 500 chars, and the
  `wake_when` / `quiet_when` text of the brief in force — the built-in one, or
  the `judge` spec's where the loop arms one.
- `since_last_tick`: a list of evidence items, each `{source, kind, age_s, text}`
  where `source` names the collector and the target (`session:chat-1751`,
  `pr:kirodotdev/KiroCrew#12735`, `work-ledger:it_42`), `kind` is a closed set
  (`transcript_tail`, `pr_state`, `pr_checks`, `pr_comment`, `pr_review`), and
  `text` is bounded per item (1 000 chars). `ledger_event` arrives with the work
  ledger collector.
- `last_verdict`: `{outcome, evidence_items, at}` and nothing else -- the previous
  tick's answer, how many items it rested on, and when. Deliberately text-free and
  carrying no fingerprint of the evidence, so a judge can see that it already
  answered on a comparable amount without being handed that evidence again. It
  cannot establish that the evidence was the SAME evidence.

Questions, asked in parallel, each atomic. The shipped seam speaks Jev's
`choice` type only (`decisions/types.py`; `_to_wire` refuses anything else), so
every question is a Choice; widening the wire to `noul`/`score` is a later PR.
That widening is PR D's: the seam must gain `noul` and `score` wire types before
a question here can ask for a bare probability or a bounded number instead of
encoding one as a Choice.

| id | type | instructions | options |
|---|---|---|---|
| `needs_owner` | choice | Does the new evidence require the owning session to act now? | `wake`: the loop's `wake_when` text; `quiet`: its `quiet_when` text |
| `outcome` | choice | What state is the watched work in? | `nothing_new`, `progress_only`, `needs_action`, `needs_human`, `finished`, `broken` |
| `urgency` | choice | How urgent is any action? | `none`, `next_tick_is_fine`, `now` |

The probability of `wake` plays the yes/no role below.

Mapping, in code, not in the model:

- `finished` or `broken` with `confidence ≥ 0.6` → **WAKE** with the verdict
  attached, so the woken session can report and decide to stop; the judge itself
  never ends the loop.
- `P(wake) ≥ 0.5` or `outcome ∈ {needs_action, needs_human}` → **WAKE**.
- otherwise → **QUIET**: re-arm, no turn.
- Low confidence (`< 0.4` on `outcome`) → WAKE. A judge that is unsure hands
  the call to System Two; it never guesses quiet.
- Any provider failure, timeout, or answer that fails validation → **FALLBACK**:
  fire, exactly as the ungated timer would. The judge can only remove turns
  that were safe to remove; it can never silence a loop.
- Quiet-streak floor: after N consecutive QUIET verdicts the tick fires anyway,
  so a miscalibrated judge cannot starve a loop forever. N defaults to the
  shipped `_MAX_QUIET_STREAK` (10 today), the same floor the PR probe already
  has, and is configurable per point.

Thresholds are constants in one module with tests, tuned from the JSONL log,
not prompt text.

### 3.1a Calibration feedback

The thresholds above are tunable from a curve, and a curve needs labels. Each
verdict is therefore labelled after the fact, deterministically, with no second
model reading the first one's work.

A verdict row is in one of three states, and the third is what keeps the labels
honest:

| state | means | label it can earn |
|---|---|---|
| suppressed | the tick withheld the turn | `missed` |
| delivered | a turn really went out | `owner_acted` |
| neither | the tick decided to wake; nothing went out yet | none |

`delivered` is stamped by the fire path at the point delivery is confirmed, not
by the tick that asked for it. A fire is refused when the slot is busy, the timer
is cancelled when the owner types, and the process can stop in between — in all
three the verdict asked for a turn that never happened, and a row marked
delivered at decision time would be handed the actions of whatever turn finished
next. A row loaded from disk as delivered but unlabelled is marked `forfeited` and
remains a permanent cycle boundary: it accepts no `owner_acted`, and its
suppressions accept no label from a later turn. A re-owed delivery has its own new
row.

`owner_acted` is `true` when the woken turn called at least one tool, or answered
longer than a quiet-cycle reply, or answered with a link; `false` when it called
nothing and answered short. A turn that changed the loop needs no separate
signal — `monitor_update` and `autonudge_stop` are tool calls, so the count
already carries them. The whole rule lives in one function,
`autonudge_judge.owner_acted`, and an unknown tool-call count reads as acted,
which is the direction that does not teach the judge to suppress. A quiet verdict
that hits the streak floor spends a turn, so it is labelled as a delivery rather
than counted as a suppression.

`missed` is read off the next delivery's label: when that delivery is
`owner_acted: true`, every suppressed verdict since the previous delivery is
`missed: true` — the owner had something to do and the judge sat on it. When the
delivery is `owner_acted: false`, they are `missed: false`. A verdict the judge
never answered is skipped: a tick that read nothing new, or could not read a
target, returns a verdict without asking, so it sat on nothing and scoring it
would bias the curve it is meant to measure.

The labels live on the loop's own record beside the quiet streak, and the store
is sized from the QUIET-STREAK FLOOR rather than from the window the judge reads:
a full streak is the floor's worth of suppressions followed by the delivery that
labels them, so a smaller store would evict the earliest suppressions before
their label arrives.

Each label is also written to the decisions log as its own `kind="wake_label"`
row keyed by the verdict's id. That row carries the id, the point name, the
session digest, one label name, one boolean, the tool-call count and the stripped
reply length: no reply, no transcript, no target. An unknown tool-call count is
`null`. The decision row carries the same `verdict_id`, so the curve joins in one
file. An id is minted only for a verdict the judge answered, because a label
pointing at a decision row that was never written is a row nobody can read.

Two fields on `loop` carry the elapsed-time half of the same reading:

- `since_last_wake_s`: seconds since this loop last delivered a turn. Omitted
  for a loop that has never delivered, because a zero there would read as a
  delivery this instant.
- `quiet_streak`: consecutive quiet verdicts, the counter the streak floor is
  measured against.

And `recent_verdicts` replaces `last_verdict` in the state once a loop has any
history: a list of `{outcome, evidence_items, owner_acted|missed, age_s}`, newest
first, so the judge sees its own recent hit rate on THIS loop. It carries
`evidence_items` because that is the field `last_verdict` held for meaning — what
lets a judge tell "still nothing" from "the same thing again" — so the supersede
is a widening rather than a trade. It is text-free — the id and the state flags
are stripped on the way out — and it survives the char budget, which spends only
evidence: a history that thinned out on a busy tick would read as a better rate
than the loop earned.

The labels reach a loop on a dashboard slot. A loop bound to a messaging channel
gets no turn-completion hook, so its verdicts stay unlabelled and its history
carries the outcome and the evidence count alone. This creates SAMPLING BIAS: the
calibration curve represents only dashboard-slot loops, while thresholds tuned
from it apply to every loop, including channel-bound loops.

A loop that stops or is deactivated during a delivered turn leaves that delivery
unlabelled, and leaves the suppressions behind it unlabelled too. The label is
absent rather than false, so the curve loses a sample instead of gaining a wrong
one. This joins the channel-bound gap as a known limit on coverage, to be weighed
by the first change that tunes a threshold from the curve.

Replacing a loop's criteria clears its labelled history. Those rows record verdicts
the previous criteria produced, and carrying them across the change would mix two
different judges' samples into one curve. A smaller sample whose rows all answer the
same question is worth more than a larger one whose rows do not, so the history
starts again with the criteria. This is the third limit on coverage, and the same
reader weighs all three.

Retroactive `missed` labels otherwise weight every suppression since the prior
delivery alike even when action appeared only near the labelling delivery; each
`wake_label` row therefore carries numeric `position_back` and `age_s` from that
delivery so a threshold reader can weight or discard far-back samples.

A threshold read segments rows on the logged `recent_verdicts` count. A verdict
decided with no history and one decided with five recent verdicts came from
different inputs; comparing them as one population reads two judges as one.

A threshold read must not treat every `owner_acted` alike. A delivery whose only
evidence is a tool call is weaker evidence of a useful wake than one that answered
at length or with a link, so pooling them overstates the hit rate. The label row
carries the tool-call count and stripped reply length so the read can separate them.

The judge stays stateless and tool-less. Everything above is data the gateway
renders into the state; nothing tells the judge what to do with a poor hit rate,
because the thresholds that consume the curve are constants in the point.

### 3.2 Evidence collectors

The tick runs in the gateway (in `AutoNudgeService`, ON its event loop, since the
caller is already a coroutine and the collectors it awaits are async), so
collectors read in-process state; no tool call, no model. The pull-request fetch is
the part deliberately pushed off that loop, because a `gh` spawn would block it.

- `pr`: for each PR URL in the message or `judge.targets`, the reading the gh-pr
  fetcher published this tick — state, mergeability, review decision, head, the
  deduped check board with its completeness flag, and comment and review bodies
  (bounded per item and in total). A reading whose own status is not `ok` counts
  as a target nobody read whole, which fires.
- `session`: for each `chat-*` key in `judge.targets`, the transcript rows
  appended since the last tick, assistant and tool rows only, last status line
  first. Creator-only: the same check `session_read_message` applies. A target
  the owner may not read is dropped and noted, never fetched.
- `work-ledger`: when the owning session is a conductor with a work ledger,
  the new events per open item (typed; they also feed the Phase 3 probe).
- `self`: the owning session's own ledger `next`, so the judge knows what the
  owner said it was waiting for.

Every collector output goes through the seam's scrub (`has_credential`, the
canonical redaction pass) before it enters state; a scrub hit drops the item
and records `scrubbed`. Nothing leaves the machine that the owner's own
session would not have read.

### 3.3 Arming: a built-in brief, and the owner's own

`monitor_start` and `monitor_update` gain one optional object, feature-gated:

```json
"judge": {
  "targets": ["chat-1751-1790052364", "https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/12735"],
  "wake_when": "a worker line starts with RULING or BLOCKED or GREEN; a PR check turns red; a bot comment raises a new finding",
  "quiet_when": "workers report WORKING with no new status; checks still running; only progress notes"
}
```

`wake_when` and `quiet_when` become the `needs_owner` question's criteria. This
is how the main session "gives the judge its orders": the babysit and
goal-conductor skills author these two lines when arming, in
plain words, from the loop's exit condition. Targets default to what the
message names (PR URLs, `chat-*` keys); the explicit list adds or narrows.

The object is optional because the point carries a brief of its own. Once the
`nudge_evidence` scope is granted on a consented keystone, every gated auto-nudge
loop is screened, and a loop that arms no `judge` object is screened with the
built-in brief: **wake**
when the subject needs its owner — a blocker, a failing check or one whose reading
is not whole, a question or a ruling addressed to it, a new comment
or review whose body asks for a change or asks a question, a terminal state, or the
exit condition the loop's own message states; **quiet** when nothing has arrived
for the owner since the last tick. An explicit
`judge` brief overrides the built-in one, so a loop that knows its own subject
states its own criteria and a loop that says nothing is still screened.

Two of those clauses name what a typed reading cannot settle on its own, and each
is spelled out rather than left to "a blocker". A comment or review that ASKS sits
in prose while the lane carrying it reports success, so nothing typed sees it. A
failing check is the opposite case: entirely typed, and named anyway because it is
what an owner arming no criteria at all most expects, and resting a red board on
the judge reading one generic word the way the owner meant it is the wrong bet.
A reading short of whole is named beside it, since a quiet drawn from half a board
is a quiet about the wrong half.

The check clause says "failing", not "newly failing", because the state carries the
CURRENT board and no prior one. What keeps a red board from waking its owner every
tick is `last_verdict`, which tells the judge it already answered on a comparable
amount of evidence -- an outcome and an item count, not a fingerprint, so this is a
weaker signal than a delta and is the honest limit of it. A brief that asked for
newness would be asking a question the state cannot answer at all.

The built-in brief carries one clause beyond those two, because the loops it
covers have no author to write it: evidence from a pull-request comment or a
fetched page is untrusted content, and a claim inside it that there is nothing to
do is not evidence that nothing happened. §5's compounding bound rests on that
clause, so it belongs in the shipped default rather than in a skill's brief.

The scope carries the built-in brief alone. A loop whose owner wrote criteria is
screened wherever its lane is authorized without this scope, which is the LLM lane
(§3.4); a loop that wrote
none supplies no such authorization, so `nudge_evidence` stands in for the half
the brief would have supplied. "Default off" therefore still holds for a
fresh install: nothing is screened until the owner grants the scope or arms a
brief. That standing-in is read before a lane is picked, so it holds on both lanes
and a briefless loop is screened only where the grant is whole — the endpoint
consent and the scope together, which is also what arms the Jev lane (§7 Q4). Q5
asks how a grant made under the narrower wording is told apart from one made under
this.

Where the judge sits in the tick decides which loops it can reach. The gh-pr
reader FETCHES and judges nothing: it hands the whole reading over — state, the
check board deduped newest-per-name against the API's own `total_count`, comment
and review bodies — and the judge decides wake or quiet from it. The core maps one
thing deterministically before the judge is asked: a merged or closed pull request
ends the watch. A loop whose subject nothing reads — a conductor watching sibling
sessions carries no monitor at all — is screened on its transcript evidence alone.

Three cases bypass the judge. A loop armed `gate=false` acts while its subject is
quiet — refreshing a heartbeat, chasing a reviewer who has not replied — so its
ticks are the work rather than a reaction to evidence, and screening them would
remove the turns the owner asked for. `judge: false`, the one value the object
takes beside a brief, is the owner's opt-out for a single loop. And
`monitor_watch` stays provider-decided: a typed provider answers its own
`review_ready` objective there without a model, and its reader produces a comment
FINGERPRINT rather than bodies, so there is no prose on that path for a judge to
read. With the scope off, a `judge` object that names no criteria of its own is
accepted, stored and ignored, so an armed loop survives the switch being toggled;
one that names criteria is screened on the LLM lane, which this scope does not
govern, while a pinned `jev` is refused for want of the same grant (§7 Q2). The
brief is what carries the screening and the lane is what authorizes it.

### 3.4 Providers

- **Jev lane** (what `auto` resolves to when the keystone consents and the scope
  is granted): the shipped `JevOracle`, keystone
  consent bound to the endpoint (`decisions_consent.json`), key only via
  `secret://TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, bounded wait, strict `_from_wire`. No change to
  the seam's trust model; `nudge.wake` is one more entry in `gate.POINTS`.
- **LLM lane** (`impl_llm.py`): the same `Answers` shape produced by a
  text-only, tool-less run of the bundled `kirocrew-lite` agent (`JUDGE_AGENT_NAME`)
  on whatever model that agent already resolves: `JUDGE_MODEL_DEFAULT` is `auto`,
  so the default inherits the session's own background-role model and pins no
  model class, and an operator who wants a specific one picks it on the card.
  It is prompted with the state and the
  questions and required to
  answer in one JSON object with exactly the question ids, each value a
  probability. The parser is as strict as `_from_wire`: any extra key, missing
  id, non-finite number or prose → invalid answer → FALLBACK. The LLM lane is
  what makes the interface real for people without a Jev key; it is slower
  (seconds) and costs a small model call, still far below a main-session turn.
  No judge-specific agent template ships: it would differ from `kirocrew-lite`
  only in the model, which the runner passes per call, and in a standing prompt
  that `render_prompt` already states more completely on every call.
- **Provider selection** is a per-point setting, `decisions.nudge_wake.provider
  ∈ {auto, jev, llm}` (`auto` = Jev when the keystone consents, else LLM),
  written through the config route like the `decisions.model_route.<tier>`
  pins. The keystone is consent to send state to the Jev endpoint, and its
  scopes are categories of that egress, so the Jev lane requires the main
  switch plus the `nudge_evidence` scope (§3.6). The LLM lane adds no
  destination (the model provider the owner's sessions already send every
  turn to) and no data class (the owner's own children's transcripts,
  creator-only), decides only quiet-or-fire, and is fail-open; it is
  authorised by `provider = llm` plus the `judge` spec the owner's session
  arms, with no keystone involvement. A loop that arms no spec is authorised by the
  `nudge_evidence` grant instead, on this lane as on the Jev one: the tick reads
  `gate.judge_evidence_scope_granted` — the endpoint consent plus this point's own
  scope — before a lane is picked, so an install with no consent recorded has no
  built-in brief on either lane (§7 Q4). That function states the rule;
  `_judge_authority` beside it states the spec half for a loop that wrote criteria,
  and `config/sections.py` repeats that half as its section's rationale. Neither
  names the briefless case, and they sit in files this document does not change.

### 3.5 Rendering

Every verdict is visible without a turn:

- a transcript notice on the owning session: `Wake judge · quiet (needs_owner
  0.08, outcome progress_only 0.91) · 2 new rows in chat-1751, checks pending
  on #12735` — one line, so a human reading the tab sees why nothing fired;
- the monitor popover shows the last verdict and the quiet streak;
- the decisions JSONL log records call metadata and the verdict (no state
  text), under `point=nudge.wake`, for calibration.

### 3.6 Where the switch lives: a row on the Decisions card

The Decisions (Jev) card in Settings → Developer → Feature Previews is a
list-and-detail over the gateway's own point registry (PR #12598): every entry
in `gate.POINTS` draws a row with a status chip, and a point that declares a
scope gets a consent switch on its detail panel, with no frontend edit. The
judge uses exactly that:

- `nudge.wake` is registered in `gate.POINTS` with a new scope
  `nudge_evidence` in `POINT_SCOPE_KEYS`. The switch text bounds what the grant
  buys, and the built-in brief makes that population wider than the words a
  reviewer of an opt-in feature would have read: not "the loops I arm" but every
  gated loop the owner runs. No machine falls through to the other destination:
  the grant a briefless loop runs on is the endpoint consent and the scope
  together, so one holding the scope alone screens nothing rather than screening
  on the LLM lane. An owner who pins `provider = llm` does send a briefless loop's
  evidence to the model provider instead (§7 Q4), which is their own naming of a
  lane rather than this switch's words reaching further than they say. One
  consequence stays a question this document does not
  settle: a consent authorizes the words it was recorded against and
  nothing wider — the rule `gate.py` states for the `tool_args` scope — while the
  keystone records one boolean per scope and no wording, so nothing distinguishes
  a grant made under narrower text (Q5).
  For the Jev lane that scope switch is the on switch; there is
  no separate feature toggle. Scope off → the Jev lane is off and a `judge` spec
  naming no criteria is stored and ignored, so a tick with no brief of its own
  behaves exactly as today; a spec that names criteria still runs on the LLM
  lane, which this scope does not govern (§3.4).
- The row's detail panel carries the point's own settings: provider
  (auto / Jev / LLM), the LLM model (from the advertised model list, "keep the
  session's own model" by default), and the quiet-streak floor. All three write
  `decisions.nudge_wake.*` keys registered in the config route's editable set.
  Choosing LLM is what turns the LLM lane on (§3.4).
- Status is the server's verdict, as for every row, and for this point it is read
  from the lane the gate would actually pick rather than from the keystone alone.
  The row reports that lane as running where it can answer, and where the picked
  lane cannot run it says which grant is missing rather than a flat off. The
  vocabulary is the card's and this document does not restate it; what belongs
  here is the consequence: a machine that grants the scope without an endpoint
  consent is screening the loops that wrote their own criteria on the LLM lane, and
  its row says so rather than reading as switched off.

Default off, in the sense a fresh install has no scope granted and screens
nothing. Turning the scope off mid-loop returns a loop running the built-in brief
to plain timer behaviour on its next tick. It is not a kill switch for the judge
as a whole: a loop whose owner wrote criteria was never screened on that grant and
keeps running wherever its lane is authorized without it, so `judge: false` is what
stops one
(§3.3).

## 4. Cost

| conductor, 3 workers, 45 min, 48 h | 64 main turns | ~6 main turns + 64 judge calls (~$0.01) | ~6 main turns + 64 small-model calls |
| PR babysit with bot-comment reading, 5 min | 288 main turns / day | ~a few main turns + one judge call per tick that has new evidence | same, on the small-model lane |
| judge provider down | — | identical to today (fallback fires) | identical to today |

Every tick with new evidence is screened, so on a busy subject the judge-call
count approaches the tick count rather than the wake count. A tick whose delta is
EMPTY costs no provider call at all: `judge_tick` answers QUIET locally when every
target was read and none had anything new, which is the row above's quiet case.

That local gate has a cost of its own worth recording rather than claiming as pure
saving. A criterion about an ABSENCE -- "no reviewer has replied in two hours",
"the branch is still behind its base" -- becomes true on a tick where nothing
changed, which is exactly the tick the gate answers without asking. So the judge
cannot serve an absence criterion today, and an owner who needs one arms
`gate=false` and pays a turn per interval. Closing that means letting a loop mark
its criteria as time-dependent so an empty delta still reaches the judge, and it is
not in this design.

The trade on a busy subject is one small-model call per tick against one
main-session turn per tick: a judge call is a bounded state and a three-question
answer on the cheapest lane, where a main turn carries the loop's whole context.

## 5. Security

- Egress: the Jev lane is behind the existing keystone consent, endpoint-bound;
  the LLM lane reuses the session's own model provider. Both receive scrubbed,
  bounded state; the decisions scanners run first; redirects are refused.
- Authority: the judge decides only QUIET vs fire; it cannot inject text into
  a turn, choose a target, or write anything. A single wrong answer costs one
  delayed or one extra turn.
- Compounding: a QUIET answer sustained across ticks compounds, and two
  populations are exposed to it on different conditions. A gated loop whose owner
  wrote criteria is screened on whatever authorizes its lane: the LLM lane needs no
  keystone grant, so `provider = llm` and the `auto` default with Jev unarmed both
  screen it, while a pinned `jev` needs the same consent and scope as anything else
  on that lane. A gated loop that wrote none is screened only where the ruled
  condition holds — the endpoint consent and this point's own scope together (§7
  Q4). So an install that granted the scope alone exposes the first population on
  the LLM lane and not the second, and one that pinned `jev` without the grant
  exposes neither.
  The evidence sustaining a QUIET is untrusted content
  crossing a trust boundary (a
  PR comment, a fetched page). Worst case, an input crafted to read as
  "nothing to do" suppresses delivery for `quiet_streak_floor × interval_secs`:
  with the default floor (`_MAX_QUIET_STREAK`, 10) and a 45-minute interval,
  7.5 hours. That is the silence a gated loop already tolerates today when
  its subject does not change; what is new is that text can now buy it. The
  bound is enforced by the floor itself, and it is the judge's own counter rather
  than the probe's: a per-loop `judge_quiet_streak` counts every tick the judge
  answered QUIET, resets only on a delivered turn, and is compared against
  `decisions.nudge_wake.quiet_streak_floor` (clamped, never off). A per-loop
  counter is what makes the bound reach a loop carrying no monitor at all, which
  the monitor's own streak field could not. Owners watching public repositories
  should set a lower floor.
  Evidence is labelled per source in `state`, and the warning that a comment or a
  fetched page is untrusted is part of the built-in brief (§3.3), so it reaches the
  briefless population too. The
  babysit skill's brief states it again for the loops that write their own.
- Targets: `session` collection is creator-only; a `judge.targets` entry the
  owner may not read is dropped and logged, never fetched.
- Fail-open by construction: every error path is the ungated timer.
- Injection: evidence is data; it is placed in `state`, never in
  `instructions`. The question texts come only from the owner's `judge` spec
  and the point's fixed strings.

## 6. Alternatives considered

- **Event-driven wakes only** ([`rfc-conductor-work-ledger`](rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md)
  Phase 3, and the earlier draft of this RFC's sibling). Correct for typed
  facts; blind to prose evidence. The two compose: the reader fetches the typed
  facts, the judge reads them together with the prose.
- **[`rfc-token-efficient-monitors`](rfc-token-efficient-monitors.md)**
  (in-progress). That RFC's monitor controller is what adds "fingerprints,
  budgets, terminal outcomes, and completed-turn accounting", and it leaves the
  AutoNudge timer in place as "the durable scheduling primitive" rather than
  replacing it. Terminal outcomes are therefore its vocabulary and not the
  judge's, which is why the mapping in §3.1 gives the judge no terminal verdict.
  The judge adds one decision at the tick and changes none of that controller's
  typed verdicts; `monitor_watch` stays provider-decided.
- **[`rfc-consolidated-monitor`](rfc-consolidated-monitor.md)** (draft). It
  merges three streams, one of which is `autonudge.py`, and states "the target
  shape, what gets deleted, and the order". The judge is a field on an existing
  loop's record (`judge`) rather than a second loop, so consolidation has
  nothing extra to merge. One dependency does follow: that document's deletion
  list includes "irq's own delivered-cycle counting and quiet-streak floor",
  on the grounds that "the structured budgets subsume them". §5's compounding
  bound is enforced by a quiet-streak floor, so when that consolidation lands
  the bound has to be restated against whatever subsumes the floor.
- **Let the main session decide with a cheaper model tier.** Still a full turn
  with the whole context; the model-tier route (#12267) shows the seam can
  pick a tier, but the cost is the context, not the model.
- **Rules (regex on status prefixes).** That is the status quo for conductor
  tails (`GREEN:` / `BLOCKED:` prefixes) and it is exactly what the typed work
  ledger replaces; regex cannot read a review comment.
- **Always-on shadow arm first.** #11490 deliberately shipped no shadow arm; the
  fallback-fires design means the live arm is already safe to run, and the
  JSONL log gives the calibration curve without a second arm.

## 7. Open questions

1. Threshold defaults (0.5 / 0.6 / 0.4) and the streak floor: tune from the
   first two weeks of logs on this repository's own loops.
2. Should the LLM lane require its own consent row on the keystone? **Ruled: no**,
   for the reason in §3.4. `auto` resolves to the Jev lane only when the keystone
   consents and the `nudge_evidence` scope is granted, otherwise to the LLM lane;
   a pinned `jev` without the scope stores the brief and runs the plain timer.
   Revisit if the lane ever sends more than the session itself would.
3. Name. Mechanism: wake judge (decision point `nudge.wake`). The fallback lane
   runs the bundled `kirocrew-lite` agent rather than a judge-specific template.
   User-facing metaphor in the toggle copy: "a secretary who
   screens the interruptions".
4. Which switch authorizes the built-in brief on each lane. **Ruled: the
   `nudge_evidence` grant, read as the narrower question, on both lanes.** PR D's
   tick reads `gate.judge_evidence_scope_granted` before any lane is picked and
   leaves the tick untouched when it answers no, so a loop that arms no criteria is
   screened only where the owner both granted the Decisions consent for the
   configured endpoint and granted this point's own scope on the keystone. Those two
   conditions are exactly what arms the Jev lane, so `auto` — the default — sends a
   briefless loop to the Jev lane the switch names, and the destination cannot
   differ from the words: a machine holding the scope without the endpoint consent
   screens nothing rather than falling to the other lane. The LLM lane screens a
   briefless loop only where the owner holds that grant and pins `provider = llm`,
   so an install that never consented to the Jev endpoint has no built-in brief at
   all; a loop that wrote criteria still runs there on the LLM lane's own authority
   (§3.4). `gate = false` is never screened and `judge: false` opts out, both read
   before the built-in brief is assembled.
5. How a widened consent is recognised. A consent authorizes the words it was
   recorded against and nothing wider, but the keystone records one boolean per
   scope and no wording or version, so an install that granted `nudge_evidence`
   under opt-in wording is indistinguishable from one that granted it under the
   wider population. Either the scope is versioned, or the wider population needs
   a scope key of its own, which is the mechanism the seam already uses to keep an
   already-consented install inert for a category it never reviewed.
6. What becomes of a script cron whose driver is retired. DECIDED: it is
   auto-paused, not deleted. The refusal itself is settled -- the watch identity
   raises and the kernel ends the run -- but ending it on the kernel's default path
   REMOVES the registration, and that registration is the only durable record the
   watch existed. The owner is told: the runner reports the ending with its message
   and the scheduler delivers that message before removing the job. What no message
   survives is the fact that a watch was ever armed, so an owner who reads it days
   later has nothing to look at.
   The cron layer already offers the alternative. A job whose run keeps failing
   crosses the auto-pause threshold and then stays LISTED with `auto_paused`, a
   `last_error` that can name `monitor_start` as the replacement, and an audit
   entry. Evidence kept, reason readable on the schedule page, and the job fires no
   more. That is what PR G implements: the refusal stands, the deletion does not.

## 8. Rollout

1. PR D — judge core: `decisions/points/nudge_wake.py`, `nudge.wake` in
   `gate.POINTS` with the `nudge_evidence` scope, collectors, the autonudge
   tick hook with fail-open mapping, `judge` on `monitor_start` /
   `monitor_update`, transcript notice, `decisions.nudge_wake.*` keys, tests.
   Q4 is settled here rather than in prose: the built-in brief rests on the
   `nudge_evidence` grant read as `gate.judge_evidence_scope_granted` — the endpoint
   consent plus this point's own scope — asked before a lane is picked, so it holds
   on both lanes and `auto` sends a briefless loop to the Jev lane the switch names
   (§7 Q4). The day-one path for a Jev key holder is to grant the scope and
   have their gated loops screened with the built-in brief, with a `judge` spec
   stating criteria of a loop's own. An install with no key pins `provider = llm`
   and gets the same screening for the loops that state criteria.
2. PR E — LLM lane: `decisions/impl_llm.py` running the bundled `kirocrew-lite`
   agent, the provider setting, and on the Decisions card (after #12598) the
   row label for `nudge.wake` plus the provider and LLM-model pickers in its
   detail panel. Depends on D's point name and on #12598's card shape.
3. PR F — skills: `babysit` and `goal-conductor` author `wake_when` /
   `quiet_when` when arming; after D merges.
4. PR G — the reader fetches and the judge decides: `probes/gh_pr.py` keeps the
   transport and drops every wake decision, the whole reading reaches the judge as
   evidence (`pr_state`, `pr_checks`, `pr_comment`, `pr_review`), the core keeps the
   one mapping it can act on (a merged or closed pull request ends the watch), and
   the script-cron driver goes, because a subprocess holds no decisions provider and
   so cannot reach a judge at all. This is the placement §3.1 rests on rather than a
   later revision of it: a typed reader that answers first decides the owner's
   criterion for them, and the criterion is what differs between two loops on one
   board. Depends on D's decision point and collectors.

   A job a user already registered from the babysit skill's copy-then-register
   recipe keeps its own copy of the script, so removing the bundled one does not
   reach it. Those jobs are REFUSED at run rather than left polling: the watch
   identity raises, and the kernel turns that into one message naming `monitor_start`
   as the thing to arm instead. The alternative is a cron that fires on schedule,
   decides nothing and reports nothing, which reads to its owner as a watch still
   running. `docs/system-specs/modules/babysit-pr-watch.md` carried the guarantee
   that the adapter remains a compatibility asset for registered jobs; PR G replaces
   that guarantee with this one and records the refusal there. The refused job is
   AUTO-PAUSED rather than deleted, per §7 Q6: it stays listed with `auto_paused`
   and a `last_error` naming the replacement, because removing it would destroy the
   only durable record that the watch existed.
