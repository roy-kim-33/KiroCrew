# RFC: Projects — portable, syncable context bundles

## TL;DR

* The context an agent needs to be useful — repos, a Jira board, Confluence
  spaces, ServiceNow records, a knowledge base — is scattered and install-bound.
  Starting the same work on a second machine means re-assembling all of it by
  hand.
* A **Project** is a named, declarative bundle of context sources: a small
  credential-free manifest stored in a Git repo (or S3 prefix), attached to any
  session by name, synced across Crew installs by plain `git pull`, and
  searchable as one federated surface.
* This is a **core primitive**, not a bookmark list. A Project answers *where
  the work items come from* and gives the agent the whole picture: sessions
  map to projects (many sessions per project) with a project view and
  one-click session creation from a project; Crew artifacts, the knowledge
  graph, steering, skills, MCP servers, agent crew, and workflows all scope to
  the project.
* Source types are **pluggable**: every entry in the manifest is handled by a
  registered *source provider* behind one SPI (validate / sync / search /
  health). `repo` is built in; Jira, Confluence, Datadog, ServiceNow, and
  anything else ship as providers — adding a source type never changes the
  manifest format or the sync engine.
* **Shareability is the load-bearing requirement.** A Project must be usable
  from any Crew instance and any workspace: clone it on a second machine, a
  teammate's install, or attach it from a different workspace on the same
  install, and the same picture materializes. Every feature in this document
  passes one test — *can it be expressed as synced bundle data plus locally
  rebuildable state?* — and anything that cannot is per-install state that
  degrades gracefully.
* Everything derived — clones, connector caches, knowledge-base indexes — is
  materialized locally per install and **never synced**. Knowledge bases travel
  as *recipes*, not blobs. This deliberately mirrors the memory-architecture
  decision that nothing merge-hostile crosses installs.
* Four phases, each independently shippable: P0 manifest + repos + pinned docs,
  P1 knowledge recipes + federated search, P2 Jira/Confluence/ServiceNow
  connectors + S3 backend, P3 team ergonomics.

## Revision 2 — the thin Project

### Why revise

The P0 implementation ([PR #7181](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/7181),
about 13k lines) went through twelve review rounds. Of roughly fifteen blocking
findings, all but two were one class: **authority read back from state an
agent shell can write.** The registry, activation records, source provenance
records, managed clones and source checkouts all lived in agent-writable
derived state, and each round found another place where a privileged reader
trusted that state — a checkout's own `.git/config` steering the owner's sync,
an activation record that could be written but never read back, a cached
attachment that outlived the Project it pointed at. Each instance was closed,
class-level guard tests held, and the final finding named the root: the
registry itself sat in a tree the sandbox deliberately leaves visible.

Almost every one of those hazards lived in the **capabilities layer** — the
code that copied a bundle's agents into the global agents dir, its skills
under `skills/projects/<id>`, and its MCP entries into the global `mcp.json`,
with an activation record to roll all of that back. Two facts, both verified
at `0640c1e0d5`, make that layer a second path for things the runtime already
provides:

* **The session's project directory already discovers its own agent
  context.** A directory bound to a session loads its `.kiro/skills` behind a
  per-directory consent grant (PR #4736), its project-local agents (PR #2167),
  and its `.kiro/steering` (PR #4361). Nothing needs to be *installed* for a
  repo's steering, skills or agents to reach a session working in it.
* **kiro-cli itself honours a workspace-level `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`** in
  the session's cwd, merged under agent-level `mcpServers` and over the global
  file (documented precedence: agent config, then workspace, then global). A
  repo that carries its own MCP config already reaches a session with zero
  Crew machinery; copying it anywhere adds a second path, not a second
  control. What Crew *does* owe is a review step over that file when the
  checkout it lives in is one Crew syncs on the owner's behalf — see "The
  synced checkout is a second channel" below.

So the thin Project keeps exactly the parts only a runtime can provide — a
synced Git workspace, a fenced binding from session to Project, a memory store
keyed to the Project, and MCP servers resolved by name — and treats everything
else in the bundle as text that loads because the cwd is there.

### What a Project is, revised

A Project is a **Git repository the gateway materializes and keeps in sync**,
registered under a fenced per-install registry, that a session binds to at
creation. The manifest shrinks to intent. This is the whole PR A schema:

```yaml
apiVersion: crew.kiro/v1
kind: Project
name: payments-platform
description: The payments platform team's working context.

sources:                       # `repo` is the only type in v1; the list shape stays
  - type: repo
    url: https://github.com/acme/payments-api
    default_branch: main
    role: primary
  - type: repo
    url: https://github.com/acme/payments-infra
    role: reference
```

Two keys this revision *describes* are deliberately absent from PR A's schema
and arrive with the PR that acts on them:

```yaml
memory:                        # PR B
  mode: project                # project | none — WHETHER, never WHICH

mcp:                           # PR C — servers by NAME, resolved against the owner's catalogue
  - name: atlassian
    scope: { site: acme, project: PAY, space: PAYDOCS }
  - name: datadog
```

Unknown top-level keys are a named validation error, so a manifest carrying
`memory:` today is refused by name and accepted once PR B lands. That is the
direction a public schema can move: admitting a key later is compatible,
retracting one that shipped parsed-but-unused is not. A key is in the schema
when something reads it, and not before. The lagging-reader side of that rule
is decided too: an install that has not yet upgraded refuses a manifest
carrying a key it does not know, loudly and by name, and upgrading is the
remedy — a Project is never half-honoured by an install that cannot act on
what it declares. `apiVersion` stays `crew.kiro/v1` across additive keys and
moves only when a key is retracted or changes meaning.

**Identity is assigned at registration.** `project.yaml` carries no `id`. The
registry mints a UUID when a Project is added and every install-local key —
the managed clone, each source checkout's provenance record, the reviewed
digest, the member record and (PR B) the memory store — hangs off that
registration id. Re-adding a location the registry already holds (a local
bundle by its real path; a Git bundle by its normalised remote and pinned
branch) returns the existing registration rather than minting a second
Project. Nothing in PR A needs a Project to be *the same one* on two installs:
install B adding the same URL gets its own id and the same checkout contents,
which is the exit criterion. Whether a manifest-carried identity is ever
needed — the one thing it would buy is a memory store that follows the repo
between installs, and memory contents never travel in the repo — is open
question 9, decided under PR B if at all. `name` is for people and may
change; the registration id is for the store and may not.

Gone from the manifest: `context.skills`, `context.crew`, `context.mcp` (as a
file of definitions), `context.workflows`, `knowledge` recipes and
`credentials`. The first three are covered by cwd discovery; the rest move to
later phases (below). `context.steering` and `context.pinned` are unnecessary
as manifest keys — a repo's `.kiro/steering` and its docs are simply files in
the checkout.

**A Project materializes as a Crew Member.** Activation is the owner's one
explicit trust step, keyed to a digest of the reviewed bundle. On approval the
gateway writes one member record `project--<id>` — `workspace` = the primary
checkout, `kiro_agent` = one generated agent template, `memory_store` = the
store below when `memory.mode: project` — and that one agent file. Removal
deletes the member record and the agent file and archives the store. There is
nothing to roll back partially, which is what deletes the rollback, ordering
and record-budget hazards rather than fencing them.

### Memory keyed to the Project

`memory.mode` declares **whether** the Project gets its own memory, never
which store. The manifest cannot name a store, because a bundle naming an
existing private store is a hijack question, and a portable store *name* buys
nothing a derived one does not — memory contents never travel in the repo.

* **The manifest declares, activation ratifies.** Nothing reads `memory.mode`
  at session time. The activation dialog shows the stake ("this Project gets
  its own private memory"); on approval a Memory V2 store named `project--<id>`
  is provisioned, owned by the `project--<id>` member, and the binding is
  written into the fenced activation record. Sessions resolve their store from
  that record only.
* **A pull can never create or select a store.** A manifest edit — by an agent
  or a `git pull` — changes the review key, the activation goes stale, and the
  binding does not follow until the owner re-activates. Re-activation keeps the
  existing store: a Project's identity is its registration id, not its
  manifest digest.
* **Binding is fixed at conversation creation.** Every conversation started on
  the Project shares that one store; attaching or detaching a Project on a live
  session refuses when the memory store would change, consistent with the
  Memory V2 rule that a missing binding never silently turns a private topic
  into Global memory.
* **Provisioning is gated exactly as any V2 member is** (`memory.private_provisioning_enabled`,
  a supported ACP backend, the WSL gateway on Windows). On an unsupported
  backend activation completes with memory listed as *unavailable*; it never
  falls back to a V1 member.
* **Removal archives the store** with files preserved, as deleting a member
  does today.

This resolves open question 6 as (a) plus (b): working memory is an
install-local private store; durable decisions are promoted into the repo as
ordinary documents, mediated by git.

### MCP by name

The bundle **references servers by name and never carries a definition**.
Definitions — command line, URL, credentials — come from the owner's own
catalogue: installed apps' `mcpServers`, the global `mcp.json`, vault slots. A
repo can therefore never introduce an executable or a credential; the worst a
hostile edit can do is ask for a server the owner has not installed, which
shows as *unavailable* at activation. This is also what makes a Project port:
every install resolves the same names against its own catalogue.

Resolution happens **onto the session's own agent at session start**, not as
an install. Agent-level `mcpServers` already exist and are already projected
onto backends; the Project's generated agent template lists the approved names
and the gateway fills in definitions from the catalogue when the session
starts. Nothing is written into the global `mcp.json`. Scope hints (`site`,
`project`, `space`) are steering text the agent reads; the tools do the rest.

Live actions on linked systems — transition a Jira ticket, write a Confluence
page — therefore arrive through the same servers a member would use, under the
same approval surface, with no Project-specific write path.

### The synced checkout is a second channel — decided, not assumed

The "never introduces an executable" guarantee above is a property of
**Crew's resolution path only**. The checkout itself is a second channel:
kiro-cli reads the checkout's own `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (full server
definitions, command lines included) and its `.kiro/agents/` (which may carry
`mcpServers`) directly from the cwd, and `sync` pulls remote commits without
any review step. A hostile commit to a linked repository could therefore land
an executable definition that the next session start runs, and the activation
digest — which covers `project.yaml` — would not notice.

Two decisions close this, one per kind of content:

* **Executable surfaces in the checkout are part of the reviewed bundle.** The
  activation digest covers, besides `project.yaml`, **everything under the
  primary checkout's `.kiro/` directory except the text-only surfaces named
  below**. It is deliberately not an allowlist of the executable files kiro-cli
  reads today (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, `.kiro/agents/`): kiro-cli owns its
  discovery surfaces and can add one — hooks, a skill's scripts — without
  Crew noticing, and a digest that enumerated files would let that new surface
  through by default. Default-stale over `.kiro/` fails the other way: a file
  Crew does not know about moves the digest and the owner reviews it. The
  carve-out is exactly `.kiro/steering/` (instructions, handled under the text
  decision below); everything else under `.kiro/` is treated as able to run
  code until the RFC says otherwise, and a guard test pins that the carve-out
  set is that one directory. `sync`
  recomputes the digest after the pull; when it moved, the Project's health
  reports *review stale* naming the changed files, and a session start or
  per-turn re-resolve on that Project **refuses** with `project_review_stale`
  until the owner re-activates. Re-activation is digest-bound: the review
  surface shows the owner each changed file's current content (added, changed,
  removed, or unreadable, with the reason) and the accept call carries the
  digest those bytes hash to; a recompute that differs refuses with
  `project_review_moved` and records nothing, so what is accepted is exactly
  what was shown. Nothing is started from a definition the owner has not seen. A repository with no `.kiro/` directory has nothing to gate. A
  surface the hardened reader cannot read as a regular in-tree file — a link
  to a target outside the checkout, an oversized file — is never an accepted
  baseline: it counts as stale on every check, because kiro-cli would follow
  the link and load a target the digest cannot see.
  The digest stops at the primary checkout because of an invariant the
  runtime holds: **a Project session's working directory is only ever the
  primary checkout** (the bundle clone when no source is declared primary).
  `reference` sources are materialized beside it and are never a kiro-cli
  workspace root, so kiro-cli never reads their `.kiro/`; a session that wants
  one as its cwd is a different Project, and PR A's exit criteria test the
  invariant rather than assume it.
* **Text surfaces inherit kiro-cli's repository-trust posture, by decision.**
  `.kiro/steering` and the checkout's documents reach the session as
  instructions kiro-cli loads from any directory it runs in; a Project checkout
  is no more and no less trusted than a directory the user opened by hand. The
  agent-side defences (injected text is data, not instructions) are the same
  ones every session already relies on. `.kiro/skills` is under the digest
  like every other non-steering `.kiro/` path (a skill can carry scripts) and
  additionally keeps its own per-directory consent grant.

This resolves what an earlier draft of this revision listed as open question 8.

### Sources, providers and knowledge — deferred, not dropped

`sources:` keeps its list shape with `type: repo` as the only built-in, and
the materialized layout stays per-source (`sources/<id>/`) so a second type is
a registration. The Python provider SPI is **not** landed until a second
provider exists: one implementation is not an interface. Linked systems arrive
as MCP by name in v1; a synced snapshot indexed into the Knowledge Library
(recipes, federated search, the Project namespace) is an optimization for the
"search across everything" case and moves to a later phase.

When a non-repo provider does land, its manifest entry names *what* (a site
alias, a project key, a space), never *how to reach it*: the credential slot
lives in the fenced per-install store and pins the host, so a manifest edit
cannot send an owner's token anywhere the slot was not configured for.

### Storage rule — the fence

Every trust-bearing Project file — the registry, activation records, source
provenance records, the approved MCP name set — lives in a **gateway-only
leaf** that is on *both* fences: `security.paths._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` (the
agent file-tool gate) *and* `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` (the OS-level mask
every sandbox mode applies). That is the treatment `memory_stores` gets. It is
**not** the treatment `trust/` gets: that directory is deliberately
sandbox-visible and read-write because in-sandbox MCP servers append to the
audit log there, which is exactly why a registry under it was reachable from
a spawned shell.

Materialized checkouts stay visible — the agent works in them — and are never
a source of authority:

* Git coordinates (remote, pinned branch) come from the registry, never from a
  checkout's `.git/config`; `sync` fetches exactly the pinned remote and
  branch.
* Every install-level or derived JSON read goes through one hardened,
  link-refusing, size-bounded reader.
* An existing checkout is reused only when its provenance record matches the
  registry's declaration; a mismatch re-clones, and the previous checkout
  survives until the replacement is recorded.

Each of these is an invariant with a guard test that fails the build on a raw
read or a Git call naming `origin` inside the Project modules; the guards and
the hardened Git store exist on #7181 and are carried forward unchanged.

### Revised migration plan

* **PR A — the thin Project** (cut from #7181, mostly deletion): the registry
  moved to the fenced leaf; `project_git.py` as hardened; a manifest reduced
  to `name`, `description`, `sources[type: repo]` — no `id`, no `mcp`, no
  `memory`, each refused by name as an unknown key; the Project id minted by
  the registry at add; slot binding (`project_id`, the composer chip, "New session
  on this Project"); the Projects rail page and sidebar entry; `sync`. No
  capabilities module, no activation record beyond the digest and the
  approved name set, no CLI group. *Exit criteria:* a Project registered on
  install A and added by URL on install B attaches to a session on each with
  the same primary checkout contents; adding a location the registry already
  holds returns the existing registration and mints no second id; a manifest
  carrying `id:`, `mcp:` or `memory:` is refused with an error naming the key;
  a spawned shell inside a Project session
  cannot read or write the registry; a manifest edit that repoints a source
  re-clones rather than reusing the old checkout; a session on a removed
  Project fails its next turn loudly through `project_not_found`; a `sync`
  that changes anything under the primary checkout's `.kiro/` other than
  `.kiro/steering/` marks the Project *review stale* and the next session start
  on it refuses with `project_review_stale` until the owner re-activates; the
  accept call names the digest of the content the owner was shown and a moved
  digest refuses with `project_review_moved`; a
  guard test pins the carve-out set to exactly `.kiro/steering/`; a session
  cannot be bound to a `reference` checkout as its working directory (the
  binding resolves to the primary checkout or refuses), so the digest's scope
  and the session's cwd are the same tree by construction.
* **PR B — memory.mode.** Adds the `memory.mode` key to the manifest schema
  and acts on it in the same PR. Activation provisions the `project--<id>` member and
  its V2 store; the binding is fixed at conversation creation; attach/detach
  refuses when the store would change; removal archives. Re-activation after a
  manifest change keeps the existing store, and flipping `memory.mode` back to
  `none` leaves the store bound until the Project is removed — the store's
  lifetime is the Project's, never the manifest's. *Exit criteria:* two
  sessions on one Project recall each other's facts; a `git pull` that flips
  `memory.mode` changes nothing until re-activation, and re-activating with
  `none` archives nothing; a private-memory provisioning refusal leaves the
  Project activated with memory unavailable.
* **PR C — MCP by name.** Adds the `mcp[]` key to the manifest schema and
  acts on it in the same PR. Names in the manifest resolve onto the session
  agent from the owner's catalogue at session start; unknown names show as
  unavailable; nothing is written to the global `mcp.json`. *Exit criteria:* a
  manifest naming a server the owner has not installed activates with that
  server unavailable and no other effect; a session on the Project sees the
  named servers' tools without any global config change.
* **Later, in any order:** knowledge recipes and the Project namespace in the
  Knowledge Library; the first non-repo provider (and only then the SPI); S3;
  auto-tagging; Project artifacts; the CLI group.

### What this dissolves

Several decisions left open by #7181's review close by construction rather
than by choice: the "Project" vocabulary collision with the composer chip
(the chip's project directory *is* the Project's primary checkout);
managed-clone-on-remove (the workspace is archived like a member's store);
whether a `project-skills.json` denial should veto activation (activation
installs nothing, so there is nothing to veto); Project MCP through the
app-kit installer versus two namespaced installers (no installer — reference
by name); and the CLI group (deferred).

### Revised open questions

Open question 1 (third-party provider packaging) is deferred with the SPI.
Open question 6 (Project memory) is resolved above, as are the synced-checkout
MCP question (decided in "The synced checkout is a second channel") and the
store's lifetime on a `memory.mode` flip (decided under PR B). New:

8. **Shared memory across Projects.** Several Projects sharing one store is an
   owner-side grouping decision, not a bundle claim. Does that need a surface
   in v1, or does one-store-per-Project cover every real consumer for now?
9. **Identity across installs.** PR A's id is install-local and nothing in it
   needs more. A manifest-carried id would let two installs agree they hold
   the *same* Project, which matters only if a store or a review acceptance
   should ever follow the repo — and both are owner-side state today. Decide
   under PR B, when memory is the first thing that could want it; until then
   the schema does not carry a key nothing reads.

## Motivation

Verified at `5cd92ff99`:

* A session's "project" today is one field: a local directory path on one slot
  (`slot.project`). It scopes file search, `@`-mentions, and — since the
  project-scoped `.kiro/` work — steering and skills. It does not travel and
  names nothing beyond a filesystem location.
* **Workspaces** (`workspaces: Record<string,{dir}>` in config) scope *memory
  and files on one install*. Two crews sharing a workspace share memory. Nothing
  about a workspace syncs, and the concept deliberately conflates "who I am /
  what I remember" with "what I am working on".
* The **Knowledge Library** is per-workspace and per-install. Its pipeline
  (chunk → entity/relation extraction → graph + FTS5 + optional embeddings)
  produces local derived state with no export, no import, and no way to
  reproduce the same library on a second install short of re-adding every
  source by hand.
* There is no Jira, Confluence, or ServiceNow reader anywhere in
  `src/kiro_crew` (grep for either term returns zero hits), and no manifest
  format that names external context sources.
* **Sessions have no grouping concept.** `slot.project` ties one session to
  one directory, but nothing groups the many sessions working the same body of
  work, no view lists them together, and artifacts, knowledge, and memory have
  no project scope at all.
* **Work items are invisible to Crew.** The tickets and issues a session
  exists to advance live in Jira/Linear/GitHub/GitLab; nothing in Crew names
  where a session's work comes from, so the agent never sees the whole
  picture — it sees one directory and one conversation.

The consequence: bringing context into a new session is manual, and bringing it
to a new *install* (a second machine, a teammate) is manual times every source.

## Goals

1. A first-class **Project**: a named bundle declaring repos, issue boards, doc
   spaces, observability views, ITSM records, knowledge bases, and pinned
   documents.
2. **Pluggable source types**: one provider SPI behind every source entry, so
   Datadog (or anything after it) is a provider registration, not an engine
   change.
3. Stored in **Git (or S3)** — versioned, diffable, shareable through the
   permission model the team already has.
4. **Attachable to any session** — dashboard, Slack, cron, subagent — injecting
   a compact project brief and setting the slot's project directory from the
   bundle's primary repo.
5. **Shareable across Crew instances and workspaces** — the key requirement.
   Synced across installs by cloning/pulling the manifest, with every install
   resolving the same sources against its own credentials; attachable from any
   workspace on an install, because a project belongs to no workspace.
6. **Searchable as one surface**: one federated search verb over local clones,
   built knowledge bases, and connector caches.
7. **Sessions map to projects** — many sessions per project: a project view
   listing them, one-click session creation from a project, and auto-tagging
   of sessions to the project they are working.
8. **Project-scoped surfaces**: Crew artifacts, the knowledge graph, and the
   project's agent context (crew, skills, MCP servers, steering, workflows)
   all attach to the project, so any session on it inherits the same working
   picture.

## Non-goals

* **Syncing memory, lessons, or session history.** Those remain install-local.
  A Project describes *what the work is*, not *what the agent remembers about
  it*. This keeps the bundle free of everything merge-hostile (SQLite WAL,
  embedding stores, last-writer-wins preference files). *Project memory* — a
  project-scoped place for what the agents learn about the work — is the one
  place this line is genuinely tense; open question 6 names the options
  without breaking the rule.
* **Carrying credentials.** The manifest names credential *slots*; it never
  contains a secret.
* **Replacing workspaces.** Workspace stays "whose memory this install uses";
  Project is "what body of work the session is about". They are orthogonal.
* **A hosted registry.** Git/S3 already provide sharing, versioning, and
  permissions; discovery infrastructure can layer on later.

## Design

A Project = a **manifest** (source of truth, small, human-editable) +
**materialized state** (derived, local, rebuildable, never synced).

### Manifest — `project.yaml`

Lives at the root of the project's git repo (or S3 prefix). Declarative and
credential-free:

```

Key properties:

* **No secrets, ever.** Each install resolves credential slots from its own
  store. A missing credential degrades gracefully: the source is listed as
  *unavailable* in project health, not silently absent.
* **Knowledge bases are recipes, not blobs.** `knowledge` entries declare how
  to *build* the KB from underlying sources. Every install materializes its own
  index through the existing Knowledge Library pipeline. The definition
  travels; the index is rebuilt. No embedding-store merge problem.
* **Pinned docs travel in the repo.** Small load-bearing documents are
  committed alongside the manifest — versioned with it, available offline.

### Source providers — the pluggable seam

Every `sources` entry names a `type`, and each type is a registered **source
provider** implementing one SPI:

```
validate(entry)        -> config errors before any network call
sync(entry, cache_dir) -> refresh the local snapshot (TTL-aware)
search(entry, query)   -> hits with provenance, from cache or live API
health(entry)          -> available | unavailable(reason) | degraded
credential_slot()      -> the named slot this provider resolves (e.g. "datadog")
```

Provider tiers:

1. **Built-in**: `repo` (git clone/fetch) ships with the sync engine — it is
   the only provider P0 needs.
2. **First-party providers**: Jira, Linear, Notion, Confluence, Datadog,
   ServiceNow, and forge work items (GitHub/GitLab issues and PRs, distinct
   from the `repo` clone provider) — shipped with Crew but structurally
   identical to any other provider; none is special to the engine. Board-level
   entries (a Jira "space", a Linear team) and item-level pins (one ticket)
   are both just provider config — `items:` narrows scope, it does not change
   the shape.
3. **Third-party providers**: a Kiro Crew app can contribute a provider the same
   way apps contribute skills and crons today, and a generic `mcp` provider
   wraps any MCP server as a source (weaker caching/search federation, but an
   escape hatch for long-tail systems).

A manifest naming a `type` with no locally-registered provider degrades the
same way a missing credential does: the source is listed as *unavailable
(provider not installed)* in project health — attach never fails on it, and
nothing else in the bundle is affected. The manifest format and sync engine
never change when a source type is added; that is the point of the seam.

### Materialized state — local only

Per install, under `~/.kiro/crew/projects/<name>/`:

```
manifest/          # the cloned project repo (or S3 sync)
clones/            # the repo provider's shallow clones (or links to existing local clones)
cache/<type>/      # one snapshot dir per source provider (jira/, confluence/, datadog/, ...)
knowledge/         # built KB indexes (chunks, FTS, embeddings)
state.json         # last sync time, per-source health, credential status, recipe hashes
```

Everything except `manifest/` is rebuildable and never syncs. The manifest
syncs by plain `git pull`/`git push` (or `aws s3 sync` with versioning for the
S3 backend).

### Storage backends

|  | Git (default) | S3 |
|---|---|---|
| Sync | clone/pull/push | `s3 sync` + bucket versioning |
| History | full, diffable | object versions (coarser) |
| Sharing | repo permissions | bucket policy |
| Conflicts | git merge (manifest is small; rare, human-resolvable) | last-writer-wins per object |
| Offline | yes | needs cached copy |

Git is primary: manifests are exactly the small, human-reviewed text git is
for. S3 serves environments where a git remote is awkward. Backend is
per-project: `crew project add <git-url>` vs `crew project add s3://…`.

### Sharing model — instances, workspaces, people

Shareability is a requirement, not an emergent property, and it has three
distinct dimensions:

1. **Across instances** (the same person on two machines, or a fresh install):
   `crew project add <url>` on the second instance materializes the same
   picture — sources, pinned docs, knowledge (rebuilt from recipes), agent
   context (behind that install's own trust grant). Nothing needs exporting
   from the first instance because nothing authoritative lives outside the
   bundle.
2. **Across workspaces on one install**: a project belongs to **no
   workspace**. Materialized state lives at the install level
   (`~/.kiro/crew/projects/<name>/`), so two workspaces attaching the same
   project share one clone set, one cache, one built knowledge graph — no
   duplication, no divergence. The workspace keeps owning memory and
   preferences; the project supplies the subject-of-work to whichever
   workspace's sessions attach it.
3. **Across people** (a team): sharing a project is sharing its repo — the
   permission model is the forge's. A teammate with read access gets the full
   picture; write access is the ability to propose or land manifest changes.
   Nothing personal leaks, because nothing personal is in the bundle:
   credentials are slots, memory is out of scope, and per-install state
   (session mappings, auto-tags, trust grants) never syncs.

The corollary is the **bundle test** used throughout this document: every
project feature must be expressible as *synced bundle data + locally
rebuildable derived state + per-install state that degrades gracefully*. A
feature that requires state to flow between installs outside the bundle
(merging caches, syncing memory, copying indexes) fails the test and is
redesigned until it passes — that is why knowledge travels as recipes and
artifact links travel as a `links.yaml` index while artifact blobs stay local.

### Sessions belong to projects

Sessions map to projects **many-to-one**, and the mapping is a first-class
field, not an inference from the directory path:

* **Attach**: a session binds a project by name (slot field, dashboard picker,
  or "work on payments-platform"). Attaching injects a compact **project
  brief** — name, description, source list with health, work-item summary,
  pinned-doc index — not the full content.
* **Dashboard integration points**: two, both deliberately boring. (1) A
  **Projects entry in the left rail** — browsing projects is a sibling of
  browsing sessions, and selecting one opens the project view. (2) The
  **new-session flow gets a project picker**: today starting a session asks
  for a directory; picking a *Project* instead pre-fills the directory from
  the primary repo and brings the brief, crew, steering, and skills with it.
  The directory-only path stays for work that has no project.
* **Project view**: the dashboard gets a per-project view — its sessions
  (live and historical), work items, artifacts, source health, last sync.
  This is *the* answer to "what is happening on payments-platform".
* **Create session from project**: one click on the project view opens a new
  session already attached — project dir set from the primary repo, brief
  injected, crew/steering/skills loaded. Optionally seeded from a work item
  ("start a session on PAY-1234") so the task arrives with its ticket.
* **Auto-tagging**: existing and incoming sessions are tagged to a project by
  evidence — project dir inside a project clone, a mentioned work item or PR
  that belongs to a project's sources — surfaced as a suggested tag the user
  confirms, never a silent reassignment. Tags make the project view complete
  without requiring discipline at session start.
* **Search**: one federated search verb over the project — clones (ripgrep),
  built KBs (FTS + vector), connector caches — with live API fallback when the
  cache misses and the credential is present. Results carry their source.
* **Relation to today's project directory**: the per-slot project dir becomes
  *derived* — attaching a Project with a `primary` repo sets the slot's project
  dir to that repo's local clone. Existing behavior (file search, `@`-mentions,
  project-scoped `.kiro/` steering and skills) keeps working unchanged.
* **Relation to workspaces**: unchanged. A workspace attaches many projects
  over time; a project is used from many workspaces and installs.

### Work items — where the work comes from

Work-item sources (Jira, Linear, forge issues/PRs) are ordinary providers, but
their content is treated as more than searchable text: the sync engine
normalizes items into a small common shape (id, title, state, assignee, url,
source) held in the provider cache, so the project brief can say "12 open
items, 3 assigned here", the project view can list them, and a session can be
created *from* one. Scope is whatever the manifest declares — a whole board, a
JQL slice, or pinned individual items via `items:`.

### Project artifacts

Crew artifacts (the artifact library) gain a project scope:

* **Attach**: an artifact produced in a project-attached session is tagged to
  the project by default; any artifact can be attached manually. The project
  view lists them.
* **Artifacts as input**: attaching a project makes its artifacts referenceable
  in-session ("use the payments dashboard artifact") the same way pinned docs
  are — part of the whole picture, not just output.
* **Reference mapping to external items**: an artifact can be *linked* to a
  work item (this mockup belongs to PAY-1234). The mapping is a lightweight
  index (`links.yaml`) in the project repo, so it syncs; the artifact content
  itself stays in the local library unless deliberately pinned into the repo.
  Whether Crew also writes the link back to the external item (an attachment
  or comment on the Jira ticket) is an open question (write-back scope).

### Project knowledge graph

The Knowledge Library pipeline (chunk → entity/relation extraction → graph +
FTS + embeddings) already builds a graph; `knowledge` recipes make that graph
**project-scoped**: each install materializes the project's KBs into a
partition keyed by the project, so graph queries, entity lookups, and semantic
search answer *within the project* by default. The graph is derived state —
rebuilt from recipes, never synced.

### Project agent context — crew, skills, MCP, steering, workflows

> **Superseded by Revision 2.** Agents, skills and steering reach a Project
> session through the session's project directory (cwd discovery), not through
> the bundle; MCP servers are referenced by name and resolved onto the session
> agent; workflows are deferred. The text below is kept as the original
> proposal.

`context` in the manifest carries the project's *agent configuration*, so a
session created from the project starts with the right working setup, on every
install:

* **steering** — project steering files, loaded like `.kiro/steering` today.
* **skills** — project skills, per-install directory trust required.
* **mcp** — MCP servers the project's work needs, per-install trust required
  (same gate as skills: listed-but-marked until trusted, never auto-started).
* **crew** — agent specs for the project's crew, so "the payments crew" is
  reproducible from the bundle.
* **workflows** — named workflow definitions for recurring project processes,
  runnable from the project view or by name in-session.

All of it is declarative config in the project repo; everything executable or
credential-adjacent sits behind the per-install trust grant.

### Sync model

* `crew project sync <name>` = pull manifest, then refresh sources: fetch
  clones, refresh caches past TTL, rebuild KBs whose recipe hash changed
  (hashes in `state.json`).
* Auto-sync via a script cron per project (no LLM): pull + refresh on an
  interval; failures surface in project health, not chat noise.
* Edits to the project are edits to `project.yaml`, pushed like any
  config-as-code. Agents propose manifest edits as diffs/PRs against the
  project repo rather than writing directly.
* **No derived-state sync, by design.** Two installs never merge indexes or
  caches; each rebuilds from the same recipe.

## Migration plan

* **P0 — manifest + repos + pinned docs + session mapping.** `crew project
  add/list/sync`, git backend, attach-to-session, project brief injection,
  primary-repo → slot project dir, the session→project field, a minimal
  project view (sessions + sources + health) behind a Projects entry in the
  left rail, and a project picker in the new-session flow
  (create-session-from-project).
  *Exit criteria:* a project cloned on a second install attaches to a session
  and sets the same project dir contents; the brief lists every declared
  source; a manifest edit pushed from install A is visible on install B after
  one sync; the project view lists every attached session and a session
  created from it arrives attached; a second workspace on the same install
  attaches the project without re-cloning or rebuilding anything.
* **P1 — knowledge recipes + federated search.** `knowledge.build`
  materialization through the existing Knowledge Library pipeline into a
  project-scoped partition (the project knowledge graph); recipe-hash
  invalidation; federated search over clones + KBs. *Exit criteria:* deleting
  the local KB index and running sync reproduces search results; changing a
  recipe triggers a rebuild on next sync and only then; graph/semantic queries
  scope to the project by default.
* **P2 — provider SPI + first-party providers.** The source-provider SPI
  (validate/sync/search/health/credential_slot), provider registry, and
  first-party providers: Jira, Linear, Notion, Confluence, Datadog,
  ServiceNow, forge work items — including the normalized work-item shape,
  item-level `items:` scoping, and session-from-work-item. Credential slots +
  health surfacing; S3 backend. *Exit criteria:* a missing credential or
  missing provider shows the source as unavailable without failing attach;
  search returns board/page/monitor/record hits with provenance; a new
  provider can be added without touching the sync engine or manifest schema
  (proven by adding the last first-party provider against a frozen engine);
  the same project round-trips through an S3 prefix. Blocked on open question
  1 (third-party provider packaging).
* **P3 — project surfaces + team ergonomics.** Project artifacts (attach,
  artifacts-as-input, `links.yaml` reference mapping), auto-tagging of
  sessions, project agent context (crew/mcp/workflows behind the trust gate),
  agent-proposed manifest PRs, project templates, full dashboard project page.
  *Exit criteria:* an artifact links to a work item and the link survives a
  fresh clone on a second install; an untrusted project's mcp/crew/workflows
  are listed-but-inert until granted; a session started in a project clone
  gets a suggested tag.

Each phase is independently shippable and independently abandonable.

## Backward compatibility

Nothing existing changes shape. `slot.project` keeps accepting a bare directory
path; a Project attachment is an additional way to populate it. Workspaces,
the Knowledge Library, and project-scoped `.kiro/` config are consumed as-is.
An install that never creates a project sees no new behavior.

## Security considerations

* **Credential-free bundle**: cloning someone's project grants no access —
  every source resolves against the local install's own credential store.
  Sharing a project shares a map, not keys.
* **Trust gate on executable content**: `context.skills`, `context.steering`,
  `context.mcp`, `context.crew`, and `context.workflows` carried in a project
  repo are third-party executable(-adjacent) content. They pass through the
  same per-directory trust grant as project-scoped skills (the #3551
  machinery): listed-but-marked until the user trusts the project checkout —
  an untrusted project's MCP servers are never started and its workflows never
  run. Pinned docs (inert text) load without a gate.
* **Prompt-injection posture**: synced Jira/Confluence/ServiceNow content is
  untrusted data, same as any web fetch — it feeds search results and context,
  never instructions.
* **Audit**: project attach/sync/trust events are SEL-audited like skills
  trust.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Extend workspaces to sync.** Rejected: workspaces hold memory and
   history, and syncing those reintroduces the merge problem deliberately
   designed out of the remote-workspace architecture. Projects stay memory-free
   precisely so they can sync trivially.
2. **Sync built knowledge bases (blobs) instead of recipes.** Rejected:
   embedding indexes are large, version-coupled to the local model, and
   merge-hostile. Recipes are tiny and deterministic enough.
3. **Per-source bookmarks with no bundle.** Rejected: the value is the bundle —
   one name that brings repos + board + docs + KB together, portable as a unit.
4. **A Crew-hosted registry service.** Deferred: git/S3 give sharing,
   versioning, and permissions for free with zero new infrastructure.

## Open questions

1. **Third-party provider packaging** (blocks P2): sources are pluggable
   behind the provider SPI — decided. What remains open is how *third-party*
   providers ship: as Kiro Crew app contributions (like skills/crons today), as
   the generic `mcp` provider only, or both. App-contributed providers get
   full caching/search federation but need a trust story; the `mcp` provider
   is weaker but needs no new packaging surface.
2. **Name identity**: is `name` unique per install with the remote URL as the
   real identity, or globally scoped like `org/name`?
3. **Multi-project sessions**: can a session attach two projects (a platform +
   a service), and if so how do primary-repo and search scoping compose?
4. **Write-back scope**: may agents write to sources (transition a Jira
   ticket, attach a linked artifact to it) through the project binding, or is
   the project strictly a read/context surface with writes staying on today's
   per-tool paths?
5. **S3 backend priority**: is S3 needed at P2, or does git cover every real
   consumer for now?
6. **Project memory**: sessions on a project accumulate knowledge about the
   work. Three options that keep the no-merge-hostile-sync rule intact:
   (a) an install-local, project-scoped memory partition (doesn't travel);
   (b) curated *project notes* promoted into the manifest repo as pinned docs
   — durable decisions sync, mediated by git like any manifest edit;
   (c) both — working memory local, promotion to repo notes as the durable
   path. Recommendation is (c); the open part is whether promotion is manual,
   agent-proposed-as-PR, or automatic.
7. **Auto-tagging confidence**: what evidence suffices for a suggested tag
   (dir-inside-clone is strong; a single work-item mention is weak), and does
   a suggestion ever auto-confirm for unattended sessions (cron, webhook)?
