# The session's log entry types

**Local page, not a mirror.** Part of the [crew log reference](README.md), which is
marked as a named exception in [the Reference index](../README.md).

Twenty-six types. Read [envelope.md](envelope.md) first for the fields every entry
carries; this page covers only each type's `data`.

Session entries are written with `src` `gateway` or `acp` and nothing else. They
never carry `thread`, and no session emitter sets `ref`. A repair closer is the one
writer that can put `gateway` on a type whose ordinary emitter uses `acp`, and it
reuses the last real entry's `time` rather than the clock.

Every subsection below follows one template: summary, kind and `src`, when written,
pairing, fields, invariants, example, reader hint, since.

## Summary

The **Emitter** column says which build writes the type. `live` means an emitter
writes it today. `#11185` means the type and its shape are settled and its emitter
lands with that pull request: on a build without it the entry is never written, so a
reader needs no handling for it yet, and each such subsection says the same thing in
its **Since** line. A type this kind owns with no emitter anywhere is under
[Removed types](#removed-types) instead of here.

## Session and turn

### `session/opened`

The crew log was created, or this claim re-attached to a conversation already on
disk.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Once per session, on create or on re-attach. A warm reuse of a
handle the process already holds is silent. Not turn-scoped, so it carries no
`turn`.

**Pairing** — None. It is not an opener: `session/closed` is a teardown marker for
the gateway's own serving, not a closer for this entry. On the resume path this
entry's write is the point the interrupted-turn repair runs.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | required | Agent name, defaulted to `kirocrew` when the caller names none. | |
| `slot` | string | required | Slot key. May be empty. | |
| `model` | string | required | Model the backend confirmed is serving this session. Empty when that id is not known. | |
| `model_requested` | string | when this process observed the allocation and a tier resolved one | Model the gateway selected for the allocation that produced this session, before the provider decides whether to send it. | |
| `cwd` | string | required | Working directory. May be empty. | |
| `owner` | string | required | Owner, defaulted to `default`. | |
| `resumed` | bool | required | `true` when this claim re-attached to an existing crew log. | |

**Invariants** — At most one per create and one per re-attach. The session's
*starting* model rides here rather than in a `model/selected` entry, which records
only a later swap. The two model fields are a pair and neither is derived from the
other: `model` is what the backend confirmed is serving, `model_requested` is what
the gateway selected for the allocation that produced the session. It is absent
when no tier resolved one AND when this gateway process did not observe that
allocation, as on a re-attach, so its absence is not by itself a claim that
nothing was selected. Selection is not transmission: a model this account cannot
run is withheld inside the provider, so this field names the choice rather than a
message the backend received. An empty `model` is
not a claim that nothing was configured, and a `model_requested` that differs from
`model` is not by itself a refusal — the backend serves the spelling it resolved.

`model_requested` is written from #12017 onward. An entry older than that carries
no such field whatever the gateway chose, so even the qualified reading of an
absent field holds only for entries written since. A fold spanning the upgrade must
read an absent field on an older entry as *unknown*, which is the same misreading
#12017 exists to remove.

```json
{"type":"session/opened","seq":1,"time":1789000000000,"src":"gateway","data":{"agent":"kirocrew","slot":"dashboard:3","model":"","cwd":"/home/u/proj","owner":"default","resumed":false}}
```

```json
{"type":"session/opened","seq":1,"time":1789000000000,"src":"gateway","data":{"agent":"worker","slot":"dashboard:7","model":"","model_requested":"claude-opus-5","cwd":"/home/u/proj","owner":"default","resumed":false}}
```

**Reader hint** — `resumed: true` means entries below this line belong to earlier
runs of the same conversation, so a reader building "this run" starts here rather
than at `seq` 1. Read `model` for what serves the session and `model_requested` for
what was chosen. Whether a request was APPLIED is not recorded here: a reader
that needs it reads the provider's own outcome rather than comparing the two
strings. When `model` is empty the served id, once known, appears on the first
`turn/completed` that reports one.

**Since** — #10091.

### `session/closed`

The gateway stopped serving this session, for a stated reason.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — At teardown. Carries no `turn`.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `reason` | string | required | The gateway's own end reason, verbatim. | |

**Invariants** — **Not the end of the file.** Entries from turns already in flight
may land after it.

```json
{"type":"session/closed","seq":210,"time":1789000090000,"src":"gateway","data":{"reason":"reset"}}
```

**Reader hint** — Do not stop folding here, and do not treat a later entry as
corruption. Read to the end of the last segment.

**Since** — #10091.

### `turn/started`

A turn was authorized and is about to run.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Once the turn is authorized, after the permit, shutdown and
stop-before-dispatch gates. A `turn/started` therefore always means the turn ran.

**Pairing** — Opener. Closed by [`turn/completed`](#turncompleted). An open
`turn/started` at the tail is what repair closes.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Message-boundary ordinal identifying the turn. | |
| `actor` | string | required | Who caused the turn. An unrecognized value is folded to `other`. | `user`, `app`, `crew`, `cron`, `autonudge`, `subagent`, `gateway`, `other` |
| `depth` | int | required | Prompt depth. | |
| `message_seq` | int | optional | `seq` of the causing message entry. Omitted when 0 or unknown. | |
| `attempt` | int | optional | Which try at this ordinal. Omitted at 1; present and greater than 1 on a rerun of the same ordinal. | |

**Invariants** — A turn ordinal may appear more than once when a turn is rerun;
`attempt` is what separates the tries.

```json
{"type":"turn/started","seq":12,"time":1789000000200,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"actor":"user","depth":0}}
```

**Reader hint** — Key a turn on `(turn, attempt)` rather than `turn` alone, taking
a missing `attempt` as 1.

**Since** — #10091.

### `turn/refused`

A turn was dispatched but a gate refused to run it.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — At the refusing gate, instead of a `turn/started`.

**Pairing** — Terminal for that ordinal on its own. It is deliberately not an open
opener, so a refusal is never mistaken for a turn that died mid-flight and never
attracts a repair closer.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `actor` | string | required | Who caused the turn. Same folding as `turn/started`. | `user`, `app`, `crew`, `cron`, `autonudge`, `subagent`, `gateway`, `other` |
| `reason` | string | required | Which gate refused. The writer records the caller's value without constraining it. | `not_authorized`, `gateway_closing`, `stopped_before_dispatch` |
| `depth` | int | required | Prompt depth. | |

**Invariants** — No `turn/completed` follows it for that ordinal.

```json
{"type":"turn/refused","seq":13,"time":1789000000210,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":4,"actor":"user","reason":"stopped_before_dispatch","depth":0}}
```

**Reader hint** — Count refusals separately from turns. Folding them together
makes a session look busier than it was.

**Since** — #10091.

### `turn/completed`

A turn ended; records its outcome and its cost.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `acp` on the measured close, `gateway` on
the failed close and on a repair closer.

**When written** — From the turn's `finally`, after all output has flushed —
not from the terminal stream event. Three writers reach it: the measured close, the
in-process failed close, and crash repair.

**Pairing** — **Closer, and written last.** Its position marks the turn boundary,
so anything after it belongs to an already-closed turn. Closes
[`turn/started`](#turnstarted). Repair writes it with `stop_reason` `interrupted`
for a turn that was still open.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `depth` | int | on a measured or failed close | Prompt depth. Absent on a crash-repair closer. | |
| `stop_reason` | string | required | How the turn ended. `failed` is the in-process failed close; `interrupted` is written **only by crash repair**; otherwise the provider's terminal reason. | `end_turn`, …, `failed`, `interrupted` (repair only) |
| `duration_ms` | int | on a measured or failed close | Measured turn duration. Absent on a crash-repair closer, which has none to report. | |
| `model` | string | on a measured or failed close | Model the turn served on. Absent on a crash-repair closer. | |
| `provider` | string | on a measured or failed close | Provider. Absent on a crash-repair closer. | |
| `credits` | float | optional | Present on the measured close, absent on a synthesized one. | |
| `tokens` | object | optional | `{input, output, cache_read, cache_write}`, all ints. Present with `credits`, absent on a synthesized close. | |
| `error` | string | optional | Exception class name — never its message — on the failed close. | |

**Invariants** — `credits` and `tokens` travel together. An in-process close
carrying neither is synthesized, and its `duration_ms` is still real. A crash-repair
closer is narrower than either: it carries `turn` and `stop_reason` and nothing else,
so a fold must read every other field with a default rather than by subscript. Cost is
measured per turn and appears only here, never on `message/sent`.

```json
{"type":"turn/completed","seq":40,"time":1789000001500,"src":"acp","data":{"turn":3,"depth":0,"stop_reason":"end_turn","duration_ms":1300,"credits":0.0021,"model":"claude","provider":"anthropic","tokens":{"input":812,"output":143,"cache_read":0,"cache_write":0}}}
```

**Reader hint** — Sum cost over these entries alone. Absent `credits` means
unmeasured, not free, so a total should carry a count of synthesized closes beside
it.

**Since** — #10091.

### `write/dropped`

One durable account of writer losses, before later entries resume.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — At the head of the session's next batch after a loss. Further
loss merges into the same pending marker rather than adding entries.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dropped_count` | int | required | How many appends were lost. | |
| `dropped_bytes` | int | required | Size hint for the lost jobs. | |

**Invariants** — It records a hole without making one: a lost job never took a
`seq`, so `seq` stays contiguous across the loss. It carries **no reason code**,
because the writer cannot separate a malformed entry from an ownership refusal at
the point it gives up.

```json
{"type":"write/dropped","seq":55,"time":1789000002000,"src":"gateway","data":{"dropped_count":3,"dropped_bytes":2048}}
```

**Reader hint** — This is the one entry that says the record is incomplete. A
reader reporting on a session should surface it rather than fold it away, and
should not try to infer *which* facts are missing.

**Since** — #10091.

## Message, request and step

### `message/received`

The body of a message the gateway accepted into this session.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Before the dispatch gates, so a refused turn still shows what
was said.

**Pairing** — None, but on an oversize body it cites its
[`message/chunk`](#messagechunk) entries and is written in the same batch as them.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `role` | string | required | Message role. | |
| `source` | string | required | Surface the message arrived on. May be empty. | |
| `text` | string | conditional | The redacted body, when it fits one line. Replaced by `chunks` when it does not. | |
| `attachments` | [string] | optional | Attachment ids. Present only when there is at least one. These are ids, not `ref`s. | |
| `attachments_omitted` | int | optional | How many ids were dropped because the list would not fit. | |
| `chunks` | [int] | optional | Chunk `seq`s, present instead of `text` on an overflow body. | |
| `chars` | int | optional | Character count of the full body, present with `chunks`. | |

**Invariants** — Exactly one of `text` or `chunks` is present. The body is redacted
at the emitter — exfiltration URLs first, then credentials — before it is measured
or split.

```json
{"type":"message/received","seq":11,"time":1789000000180,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"role":"user","text":"fix the build","source":"dashboard"}}
```

**Reader hint** — Handle both body forms. Reconstruct an overflow body by reading
the `chunks` seqs in order and concatenating their `delta` values.

**Since** — #10091.

### `message/sent`

A finished assistant message — one model call's worth of text.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `acp`.

**When written** — When a reply is complete. An empty body writes nothing.

**Pairing** — None, but cites its [`message/chunk`](#messagechunk) entries on an
oversize body.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `step` | int | optional | Model call ordinal. Omitted when 0 or unknown. | |
| `text` | string | conditional | The redacted body, when it fits one line. | |
| `interrupted` | bool | optional | Written only as `true`, when a steer cut this reply. | `true` |
| `chunks` | [int] | optional | Chunk `seq`s, present instead of `text` on overflow. | |
| `chars` | int | optional | Character count of the full body, present with `chunks`. | |

**Invariants** — Exactly one of `text` or `chunks`. `interrupted` is never written
`false`, so absence means "not interrupted". This entry carries no usage: cost
rides on [`turn/completed`](#turncompleted).

```json
{"type":"message/sent","seq":39,"time":1789000001400,"src":"acp","data":{"turn":3,"step":2,"text":"Done."}}
```

**Reader hint** — Several of these per turn is normal — one per model call. Do not
treat the first as the turn's answer.

**Since** — #10091.

### `message/chunk`

One slice of an oversize body.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is inherited from the body entry that cites
it — `acp` under a `message/sent`, `gateway` under a `message/received`.

**When written** — Only by the overflow split, never on its own.

**Pairing** — Cited by the body entry that names its `seq` in `chunks`. All the
chunks and the citing entry are written in one batch, so a reader either sees the
whole group or none of it.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `step` | int | optional | Model call ordinal, on assistant bodies. | |
| `delta` | string | required | One redacted slice of the body. | |

**Invariants** — Always `ignorable: true`. A **trailing** chunk run whose citing
entry never landed is truncated by repair, so a chunk that survives always has a
citing entry.

```json
{"type":"message/chunk","seq":41,"time":1789000001410,"src":"acp","ignorable":true,"data":{"turn":3,"step":2,"delta":"the first slice of the body"}}
```

**Reader hint** — Never read these directly. Start from a body entry's `chunks`
list; a reader that does not understand the type may skip them, which is what
`ignorable` promises.

**Since** — #10091.

### `message/queued`

A message arrived while a turn was already running.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — On arrival, when a turn is in flight.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | string | required | Surface it arrived on. | |
| `bytes` | int | required | Size of the queued message. | |
| `queued_seq` | string | required | The queue entry's own id. A string, not a crew log `seq`. | |

**Invariants** — Carries **no `turn`**: it belongs to no turn yet. The body is not
recorded here; it lands in [`message/received`](#messagereceived) when the queue
drains.

```json
{"type":"message/queued","seq":30,"time":1789000000900,"src":"gateway","data":{"source":"slack","bytes":214,"queued_seq":"q-8"}}
```

**Reader hint** — `queued_seq` names a queue slot and must not be resolved as a
crew log `seq` or fed to a `ref`.

**Since** — #10091.

### `request/configured`

The request configuration, recorded when it changed.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Change-only per session. An unchanged configuration is silent,
and the fingerprint is remembered only after the line lands.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `model` | string | required | Model. | |
| `provider` | string | required | Provider. | |
| `context_window` | int | required | Context window size. | |
| `system` | string | optional | sha256 digest of the system prompt, when one is supplied. | |
| `system_bytes` | int | optional | Byte length of the system prompt, present with `system`. | |

**Invariants** — The system prompt is digested, never recorded. No resolved tool
list is written: with tool search on, the gateway does not receive one.

```json
{"type":"request/configured","seq":10,"time":1789000000150,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"model":"claude","provider":"anthropic","context_window":200000}}
```

**Reader hint** — The absence of this entry on a turn means the configuration
matches the last one recorded, not that it is unknown. Carry the value forward.

**Since** — #10091.

### `context/composed`

What the gateway put in front of the model, block by block.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Per model call that composes a prompt. Nothing is written when
there are no blocks to tally.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `sources` | [object] | required | Per-block `{kind, chars, tokens}`, ordered by descending `chars`. | |
| `chars` | int | required | Total characters. | |
| `tokens` | int | required | Estimated tokens. | |
| `tokens_estimated` | bool | required | Always `true`. | `true` |
| `step` | int | optional | Model call ordinal. Omitted when 0. | |

**Invariants** — `tokens` is an estimate derived from `chars`, which is why
`tokens_estimated` is written on every entry rather than only when it is true.
Blocks with no classification are folded into a single `other` source, so `sources`
does not enumerate every injected block by name.

```json
{"type":"context/composed","seq":9,"time":1789000000140,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"sources":[{"kind":"system","chars":4000,"tokens":1000},{"kind":"other","chars":1200,"tokens":300}],"chars":5200,"tokens":1300,"tokens_estimated":true}}
```

**Reader hint** — Do not report these token numbers as billed usage. The billed
figures are on [`turn/completed`](#turncompleted).

**Since** — #10091.

### `step/started`

Opens one model call inside a turn.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — Right after `turn/started` once the turn is authorized, and
again at each transition from a tool group back to text.

**Pairing** — Opener. Closed by [`step/completed`](#stepcompleted).

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `step` | int | required | Model call ordinal, from 1. | |

**Invariants** — Steps are numbered within a turn, so `(turn, step)` identifies a
model call.

```json
{"type":"step/started","seq":14,"time":1789000000220,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"step":1}}
```

**Reader hint** — Step count per turn is the cheapest measure of how much
tool-calling a turn did.

**Since** — #10091.

### `step/completed`

Closes one model call and records how long it took.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — At the next transition, and beside the turn's completion event.
Nothing is written when the step ordinal is 0.

**Pairing** — Closer for [`step/started`](#stepstarted). Repair writes no step
closer, so a step may be left open by a crash.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `step` | int | required | Model call ordinal. | |
| `ms` | int | required | Duration, never negative. | |

**Invariants** — `ms` measures the model call, not the turn.

```json
{"type":"step/completed","seq":38,"time":1789000001390,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"step":1,"ms":900}}
```

**Reader hint** — An open `step/started` with a `turn/completed` after it means the
turn ended mid-step. That is expected, not damage.

**Since** — #10091.

## Tool and approval

### `tool/called`

A tool call, identified by id. Arguments are digested, never recorded.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `acp`.

**When written** — On the call frame.

**Pairing** — Opener. Closed by [`tool/completed`](#toolcompleted) matched on
`call_id`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `call_id` | string | required | Tool call id. Empty when the frame carried none. | |
| `name` | string | required | Trusted tool name. Empty when the backend supplied none. | |
| `server` | string | required | MCP server name. Empty when there is none. | |
| `kind` | string | required | Tool kind. | |
| `call_index` | int | optional | Position among the turn's tool calls. Omitted when 0. | |
| `step` | int | optional | Model call that issued it. Omitted when 0. | |
| `args_hash` | string | optional | sha256 of the serialized arguments, when there are any. | |
| `args_bytes` | int | optional | Byte length of the serialized arguments, present with `args_hash`. | |

**Invariants** — Argument *content* never reaches the crew log. `args_hash` lets two
calls be compared for equality without recording what was passed.

```json
{"type":"tool/called","seq":16,"time":1789000000300,"src":"acp","data":{"turn":3,"call_id":"c-01","name":"read","server":"","kind":"fs","call_index":1,"step":1,"args_hash":"9f2b7c41","args_bytes":42}}
```

**Reader hint** — `call_id` may be empty, so it is not a safe dictionary key on its
own. Fall back to `(turn, call_index)`.

**Since** — #10091.

### `tool/completed`

A tool call's terminal frame. Results are digested, never recorded.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `acp` on both the ordinary close and the
turn-end sweep, and `gateway` only on a repair closer.

**When written** — Three writers: the ordinary terminal frame; the sweep that
closes still-open calls at a tool-group boundary or at turn end; crash repair.

**Pairing** — Closer for [`tool/called`](#toolcalled), matched on `call_id`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `call_id` | string | required | The same id as the call. | |
| `name` | string | required | Filled from the remembered call frame. | |
| `server` | string | required | Filled from the remembered call frame. | |
| `status` | string | required | Outcome, as an **open set**: the terminal frame passes the backend's own word through unmapped, so a value outside the list below is possible and must not be treated as invalid. `refused` is decided by this process and wins over the frame's word. The sweep writes `completed` at a tool-group boundary and `unknown` at turn end; repair writes `unknown` for a call it cannot match. | `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `canceled`, `refused`, `unknown` |
| `call_index` | int | optional | Present when known. | |
| `step` | int | optional | Present when known. | |
| `elapsed_ms` | int | optional | Present when the call frame was still in memory. | |
| `is_error` | bool | optional | Tri-state: omitted when the caller made no assertion either way. | |
| `result_hash` | string | optional | sha256 of the redacted result, when there is one. | |
| `result_bytes` | int | optional | Byte length. `0` on an output-less close, absent when there was nothing to digest. | |

**Invariants** — `status: "unknown"` means the writer could not observe the
outcome, not that the tool failed. Both `cancelled` and `canceled` occur, because the
word is the backend's and is not normalized on the way in. A sweep close carries
`result_bytes: 0` and no `result_hash`.

```json
{"type":"tool/completed","seq":18,"time":1789000000400,"src":"acp","data":{"turn":3,"call_id":"c-01","name":"read","server":"","status":"completed","call_index":1,"step":1,"elapsed_ms":90,"result_hash":"1a3c9e02","result_bytes":512}}
```

**Reader hint** — Do not count `unknown` as a failure. Distinguish it from
`is_error: true`, which is a real reported error.

**Since** — #10091.

### `approval/requested`

A tool call is waiting on a human.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — One statement before the `try` whose `finally` records the
decision, so a request can never be lost while its decision is written.

**Pairing** — Opener. Closed by [`approval/decided`](#approvaldecided) matched on
`approval_id`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `approval_id` | string | required | Approval request id. | |
| `tool` | string | optional | Tool name. Absent when the frame named none. | |
| `reason` | string | optional | The redacted, clipped title shown to the human. Absent when there is none. | |

**Invariants** — `reason` is what a person saw, not the tool's arguments.

```json
{"type":"approval/requested","seq":24,"time":1789000000600,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"approval_id":"a-1","tool":"shell","reason":"remove the build directory"}}
```

**Reader hint** — An unmatched request means the process died while a human was
still deciding.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

### `approval/decided`

How an approval resolved.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — From the `finally` that every exit path converges on: a human
answer, a timeout, a no-budget decline, a delivery failure, a cancelled wait.

**Pairing** — Closer for [`approval/requested`](#approvalrequested). Repair closes
an unmatched request with `decision` `unknown`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `approval_id` | string | required | The same id as the request. | |
| `decision` | string | required | The decision. `unknown` is written **only by crash repair**. | `unknown` (repair only) |
| `by` | string | optional | Written only for a host-made decision. Omitted for a person's own answer. | `host` |
| `cause` | string | optional | The host's reason code for an automatic decline. | |

**Invariants** — Absence of `by` is the signal that a human answered. A reader must
not read it as an unattributed decision.

```json
{"type":"approval/decided","seq":25,"time":1789000000650,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"approval_id":"a-1","decision":"approved"}}
```

**Reader hint** — To count what a person actually approved, filter to entries with
no `by`.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

## Model, compaction and plan

### `model/selected`

The model a session will serve, and why it was chosen.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — On a swap, such as a fallback. The session's starting model is
not written here; it rides on [`session/opened`](#sessionopened).

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | required | Model id. | |
| `source` | string | required | Why this model was chosen. | |
| `turn` | int | optional | The turn the pick was made for. Omitted when 0 or outside a turn. | |

**Invariants** — An entry here means the served model differs from the one
`session/opened` recorded.

```json
{"type":"model/selected","seq":26,"time":1789000000700,"src":"gateway","data":{"model":"claude-fallback","source":"fallback","turn":3}}
```

**Reader hint** — To know which model served turn N, take the latest
`model/selected` at or before it, falling back to `session/opened`.

**Since** — #10091.

### `compaction/applied`

A compaction, recorded as context-usage percentages.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — When the compaction verdict settles, which may be later than the
turn it measures.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pct_before` | float | required | Context usage percentage before, rounded to 4 decimal places. | |
| `pct_after` | float | required | Context usage percentage after. | |
| `freed_pct` | float | required | `pct_before` minus `pct_after`. Negative when a deferred reading takes in a later turn's growth. | |

**Invariants** — Carries **no `turn`**, because its verdict can settle turns after
the compaction it describes. No raw token counts: the boundary measures only
percentages.

```json
{"type":"compaction/applied","seq":50,"time":1789000001800,"src":"gateway","data":{"pct_before":82.0,"pct_after":41.0,"freed_pct":41.0}}
```

**Reader hint** — A negative `freed_pct` is a real reading, not a bug. Do not clamp
it to zero.

**Since** — #10091.

### `plan/updated`

The session's own task list, as the agent just restated it.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `acp`.

**When written** — Each time the agent restates its list. A `null` list writes
nothing; an empty list is a cleared plan and is written.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | int | required | Turn ordinal. | |
| `items` | [object] | required | Each `{id, text, state}`. | `state`: `done`, `open` |
| `total` | int | optional | The real count, written only when the list was clipped by count or by bytes. | |

**Invariants** — A whole list, not a delta. Always `ignorable: true`. `total`
greater than `len(items)` means what is written is a prefix.

```json
{"type":"plan/updated","seq":28,"time":1789000000800,"src":"acp","ignorable":true,"data":{"turn":3,"items":[{"id":"1","text":"read code","state":"done"},{"id":"2","text":"write fix","state":"open"}]}}
```

**Reader hint** — Diff consecutive entries to see progress. Treat an empty `items`
as "plan cleared", not as "no data".

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

## Background work and children

### `background/completed`

A model call the gateway made on this session's behalf.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — When such a call finishes. It runs after a turn ends, on a
separate session, so it carries no `turn`.

**Pairing** — None.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | required | Which background call this was. The writer records the caller's value without constraining it; the calling sites emit the values listed here. | `title`, `summary`, `memory_consolidation` |
| `model` | string | optional | Served model. | |
| `provider` | string | optional | Provider. | |
| `credits` | float | optional | Written only when the call was billed, so a zero cost is absent. | |
| `tokens` | object | optional | Only the non-zero billed dimensions of `{input, output, cache_read, cache_write}`. | |
| `ms` | int | optional | Wall clock. Omitted at 0. | |

**Invariants** — Carries **no `turn`**. `tokens` is sparse by construction: a
missing dimension means zero, not unknown.

```json
{"type":"background/completed","seq":60,"time":1789000002100,"src":"gateway","data":{"kind":"title","model":"claude-haiku","provider":"anthropic","credits":0.0001,"tokens":{"input":40,"output":8},"ms":300}}
```

**Reader hint** — Add this cost to a session's total separately from
`turn/completed`; it is real spend that belongs to no turn. Treat `kind` as an open
set and keep an "other" bucket.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

### `subagent/spawned`

A child this session dispatched.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — When the run actually starts, not when it is queued.

**Pairing** — Opener. Closed by [`subagent/completed`](#subagentcompleted) or
[`subagent/failed`](#subagentfailed), matched on `agent_id`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_id` | string | required | The child's id. | |
| `turn` | int | optional | The asking turn. Absent when no turn asked — a slash command, a cron, a hook. | |
| `agent` | string | optional | Agent name. | |
| `model` | string | optional | The child's model. | |
| `scope` | object | optional | Context-scope flags `{memory, lessons, project}`, all bools. | |

**Invariants** — Carries **no `ref`**. No subagent path opens a child crew log, so a
citation would name a file that does not exist.

```json
{"type":"subagent/spawned","seq":32,"time":1789000000850,"src":"gateway","data":{"turn":3,"agent_id":"sub-1","agent":"kirocrew","model":"claude","scope":{"memory":false,"lessons":true,"project":true}}}
```

**Reader hint** — A missing `turn` is normal and does not mean the entry is
damaged. Group children by `agent_id`, not by turn.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

### `subagent/steered`

A correction sent into a running child.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — When the steer is sent.

**Pairing** — None. It is written into the parent's crew log, because the child has
none of its own.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_id` | string | required | The child's id. | |
| `mode` | string | optional | How the steer was delivered. | `interrupt`, `follow_up` |

**Invariants** — The steer text is not recorded here.

```json
{"type":"subagent/steered","seq":33,"time":1789000000860,"src":"gateway","data":{"agent_id":"sub-1","mode":"follow_up"}}
```

**Reader hint** — Several of these may sit between one spawn and its close.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

### `subagent/completed`

A child finished its work.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — On the success outcome only.

**Pairing** — Closer for [`subagent/spawned`](#subagentspawned).

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_id` | string | required | The child's id. | |
| `ms` | int | optional | Elapsed time. Omitted at 0. | |

**Invariants** — Carries no `tokens` and no `credits`: the subagent runtime
measures neither, so a child's cost is not recoverable from the parent's log.

```json
{"type":"subagent/completed","seq":70,"time":1789000002500,"src":"gateway","data":{"agent_id":"sub-1","ms":40000}}
```

**Reader hint** — Do not attribute child cost from this entry. There is none to
attribute.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

### `subagent/failed`

A child did not finish its work.

**Kind and `src`** — `session`; `src` is `gateway`.

**When written** — On either non-success outcome.

**Pairing** — Also a closer for [`subagent/spawned`](#subagentspawned). Repair
closes an unmatched spawn with `outcome` `unknown`, and only for a child a
liveness predicate reports finished — with no predicate the spawn is left open
rather than closed on a guess.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Enum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_id` | string | required | The child's id. | |
| `outcome` | string | optional | Which non-success outcome. Defaults to `failed`, so it is absent only when a caller passes an empty value. `unknown` is written **only by crash repair**. | `failed`, `stopped`, `unknown` (repair only) |
| `reason` | string | optional | Redacted, clipped failure reason. | |
| `ms` | int | optional | Elapsed time. Omitted at 0. | |

**Invariants** — This one type covers both non-success outcomes; `outcome` is what
separates them.

```json
{"type":"subagent/failed","seq":71,"time":1789000002510,"src":"gateway","data":{"agent_id":"sub-2","reason":"provider error","outcome":"failed","ms":12000}}
```

**Reader hint** — A spawn with no close at all means the parent died while the
child was running and no liveness predicate was available.

**Since** — type #10091; written by #11185.

## Removed types

These nine are owned by the `session` kind in the format and have no emitter in any
open change, so they are removed rather than kept as unwritten declarations. That is
the line between this table and an `#11185` row in the summary: a type here has no
writer to wait for, while an `#11185` row has one on the way. `message/steered` sits
here even though its emitter function exists, because nothing calls it. A reader needs
no handling for anything in this table.

| Type | Why it is removed |
|---|---|
| `session/seeded` | Specified for a legacy-transcript import path that no code performs. |
| `message/steered` | No single site observes both the interrupted text's flush and the steer echo, so any one writer would record a `seq` that contradicts causality. What the cut site can prove is already recorded by `message/sent.interrupted` and the requeue's `message/queued`. |
| `tool/searched` | A tool search reaches the gateway as an ordinary tool-call frame, so it is already recorded as `tool/called` and `tool/completed`. A second entry would put one fact at two `seq`s, and its query and hit count would break the rule that arguments are digested, never recorded. |
| `tool/loaded` | Its token-cost field has no source anywhere in the repository. |
| `skill/searched` | A skill search is an MCP tool call, already recorded. |
| `skill/loaded` | Reading a skill file is already a tool call, and its token field has no source: the loader counts characters. |
| `summary/written` | Its coverage field names crew log `seq`s, and the summary path holds nothing that can name one, so the field would have to be fabricated. |
| `remote/placed` | Its provider and id fields have no source at the placement site. |
| `remote/lost` | Its reason field has no source at the relay site. |
