# Cross-platform: route POSIX calls through `platform_compat`

Kiro Crew runs on macOS, Linux (x86_64 and ARM), and Windows (native). `fcntl`,
`termios`, `resource` and `pty` do not exist on Windows, and
**`os.kill(pid, 0)` TERMINATES the target there**: it is not a liveness probe.

`kiro_crew.platform_compat` owns one helper per POSIX call the codebase needs. Reach
for the helper, not the stdlib call, even in code you believe only runs on POSIX — the
import alone is enough to break a Windows install, and the failure lands at import time
in a module a Windows user cannot avoid.

This is the contract. The Windows install and runtime story a user follows is
[windows-install.md](../../guides/windows-install.md).

## Why a table rather than a rule

Half of these are not "the POSIX call is missing on Windows". They are cases where the
stdlib call **exists and answers wrongly**: it silently no-ops, it returns a
high-water mark where a live reading was wanted, its unit differs per platform, or it
follows a link planted at the name. A rule of the form "guard it with `IS_POSIX`"
produces exactly those silent failures, which is why the helper is named per call.

## The helper for each call

| Need | Use (`platform_compat`) | NOT |
|------|--------------------------|-----|
| Tail a rotating log | `open_log_file_for_tail(path)` returns a binary read descriptor (caller closes); Windows permits read/write/delete sharing so the writer can rename during a read. Only for log readers, never security pinning. | plain `open` held while a Windows writer rolls over |
| File lock | `file_lock(fd, exclusive=)` / `acquire_lock`+`release_lock` / `try_acquire_lock` | `fcntl.flock` |
| Liveness probe | `pid_exists(pid)` / `pid_liveness(pid)` | `os.kill(pid, 0)` (kills on Windows!) |
| Kill a process | `kill_pid(pid, sig)` | `os.kill(pid, sig)` |
| Kill a tree | `kill_process_tree(pid, sig)` | `os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid), sig)` |
| Parent PID | `get_ppid(pid)` | `/proc` read / libproc |
| Session process identity | `get_process_start_id(pid)`; Windows uses query-only creation FILETIME, Linux start ticks, macOS libproc microseconds | caller-supplied PID or a bare PID without its creation identity |
| Linux execution-boundary equality | `process_namespaces_match(pid, reference_pid)`; compares user and mount namespace inodes with incarnation checks; `None` on unreadable or unsupported platforms | absent current ancestry as proof that a process is unconfined |
| macOS inherited sandbox state | `process_is_sandboxed(pid)`; read-only Seatbelt query with an incarnation check; `None` on errors or other platforms | treating an unavailable query as unsandboxed |
| macOS sandbox file-read permission | `process_can_read_under_sandbox(pid, trusted_absolute_path)`; queries Seatbelt without opening the file, checks incarnation before and after, and returns `None` on unknown | treating all sandboxed processes as either private or Global; a query error as a grant |
| Loopback TCP caller PID | `get_tcp_peer_pid(sockname[:2], peername[:2])`; unique ESTABLISHED reverse IPv4/IPv6 tuple, failure is unknown. Linux maps the kernel socket inode to process FDs; macOS uses trusted system lsof; Windows uses the owner-PID table. Offload this probe; prefer Unix peer credentials where available. | HTTP headers, a listener's PID, or matching only a port |
| Match process cmdline | `process_matches(pid, needles)` | `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` / `ps` |
| Process start time (PID-reuse guard) | `process_start_time(pid)` | `/proc/<pid>/stat` / `ps -o lstart=` (both answer `None` on Windows, so the guard silently never confirms) |
| Is this pid a PROCESS rather than a thread | `is_thread_group_leader(pid)` for one pid; `live_thread_group_leaders()` once for a whole sweep | `pid_exists(pid)` alone (Linux numbers threads from the pid space and POSIX permits signalling a tid, so a pid recycled as a THREAD of an unrelated process reads as alive forever). Both answer `None`, never `False`, when unknowable — treat `None` as "retain", never as licence to act |
| Signals | `platform_compat.SIGKILL` / `SIGTERM` | `signal.SIGKILL` (undefined on Windows) |
| Spawn isolation | `start_new_session=IS_POSIX` + `creationflags=CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` | bare `start_new_session=True` |
| Wait on a subprocess PIPE with a deadline | a daemon reader thread feeding a `queue.Queue`, consumed with a bounded `get` (`testing/harness.py`'s `_StdoutPump`) | `selectors.DefaultSelector()` on the pipe (select()-based on Windows, which accepts SOCKETS only, so registering a pipe RAISES there) |
| Re-exec the current Python module | `reexec_python_module(module, args)` | `os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable, ...])` (breaks when the Windows interpreter path contains spaces) |
| Replace the current process with another program (a supervised service body) | spawn a child, record its pid + `process_start_time`, and `wait()` on it under `IS_WINDOWS` (see `pod.windows.supervise_gateway`) | `os.execve` (on Windows this SPAWNS and terminates the caller, so the pid changes and the service manager sees the unit exit while the real program keeps running orphaned) |
| Open an exact Windows process object for later tree discovery/termination | `open_process_termination_handle(pid, expected_token)` validates the opened handle's creation identity before returning it (caller closes with `close_process_handle`); combine with `descendant_termination_handles` so the anchored root and each retained child receive a final post-exit snapshot | opening by PID and checking the token beforehand (PID reuse can occur between those operations) |
| Race-free Job object assignment | `creationflags \|= CREATE_SUSPENDED`, then `apply_job_limits`, then `resume_process_main_thread` | assigning a job to an already-running child (descendants it already spawned escape) |
| Fork-bomb / memory ceiling on a spawned tree | `sandbox.apply_windows_resource_ceiling(pid)` after the spawn, alongside `cgroup_scope_argv` | `cgroup_scope_argv` alone (a no-op on Windows, so no ceiling at all) |
| File mode | `chmod_safe(path, mode)` / `fchmod_safe(fd, mode)` | `os.chmod` / `os.fchmod` (no `os.fchmod` on Windows) |
| Owner-only secret (fail-loud) | `restrict_to_owner(path)` | `os.chmod(path, 0o600)` under `if IS_POSIX` (silent no-op leaves secrets world-readable) |
| Owner-only secret directory (fail-loud, inheritable) | `restrict_dir_to_owner(path)`; `make_owner_only_dir(path)` to also create it (its tighten step is best-effort) | `restrict_to_owner(path)` on a directory (its Windows grants carry no `(OI)(CI)`, so files created inside land on the default DACL, not owner-only; its `0o600` also drops the execute bit a directory needs) |
| Confirm a Linux readonly filesystem | `is_readonly_filesystem(path)`; false for other platforms or probe failure. Used to reject a private-runtime diagnostic marker planted in the writable host home. | `os.statvfs` in a cross-platform consumer, or readonly file mode alone |
| Directory link | `symlink_or_junction(target, link)` | `os.symlink` (`WinError 1314` without elevation) |
| Detect/remove a dir link | `is_link_or_junction(path)` / `unlink_link_or_junction(path)` | `path.is_symlink()` (misses a Windows junction) |
| Hold a directory in place while a child writes into it by path | `pin_directory(path)` (then `os.close`) | `os.open(dir, O_RDONLY)` (EACCES on Windows, and even where it opens it follows a link planted at the name) |
| Process RSS (live) / peak RSS / CPU | `proc_rss_bytes()` / `proc_peak_rss_bytes()` / `proc_cpu_seconds()` | `resource.getrusage` (`ru_maxrss` is a high-water mark, never a live reading, and its unit is KiB on Linux but bytes on macOS) |
| Available host memory | `host_available_mib()` (0 = unknown, never 0 = no memory) | `/proc/meminfo` directly (Linux-only, so the bound built on it silently vanishes on macOS and Windows) |
| FD soft limit | `raise_nofile_soft_limit(n)` | `resource.setrlimit` |
| Port to PID | `find_listening_pids(port)` / `listening_pid_tool_available()`; `find_port_listeners(port)` when ownership must be scoped to the local address actually probed | `lsof` directly |
| Spawn a system tool (`ps`, `lsof`, `netstat`, `taskkill`) | `trusted_system_bin(name)`, treating `None` as "unavailable" | a bare argv name (resolved through a `PATH` that can lead with same-uid-writable dirs) |
| Read a Windows system tool's ANSWER (`schtasks /Query`, `tasklist`, `sc query`) | the tool's **exit code**, or a fact the program under test recorded itself | parsing its stdout (column headers AND status words are translated by the UI language, so a match on `"Running"` reports every instance down on a non-English host — the fail-OPEN direction) |
| strftime no-pad | `strftime(dt, "%-I")` | bare `dt.strftime("%-I")` (`ValueError` on Windows) |

## Embedding threading and cancellation

Embedding cancellation uses `threading.Event` and monotonic deadlines on all
supported platforms. It cancels queued work, not a running native inference.
Executor admission follows the underlying future's completion, never the
cancelled asyncio waiter's lifetime. Cache stripes and dispatch locks never
cover native inference; store alignment holds only Python locks and performs
no model load or inference.

## Exact-handle descendant continuity on Windows

An open Windows process handle pins its process object and prevents PID reuse even
through exit; reuse is possible only after exit and the last handle closes
([Windows process-object lifetime](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110107-00/?p=11803)).
`windows.stop` retains root/descendant handles through every scan and closes them
only in its outer `finally`, so excluding retained PIDs cannot hide a replacement.
Host-effect tests must attempt authoritative teardown in `finally`; OS refusal or
incomplete identity proof must fail loudly and preserve isolated HOME/service
evidence, never certify zero residue or invoke an unsafe duplicate cleanup authority.
Service-free, newly owned precondition cleanup is a separate case.

A missing live root is not a completed drain. Before `/End`, `windows.stop`
refuses when it cannot anchor a live root and finds a PID record (including
malformed/unreadable/dead/reused identities), wrapper, result, handoff marker,
HOME, or registered task. State observed before settling is retained as evidence
if the supervisor clears it while stop waits. A settled handoff does not prove
its descendants stopped; a handoff observed after the original tree drain also
blocks deletion, even if its marker disappears while waiting. Only a plane with
no prior runtime evidence can take the unanchored, never-started no-op path.
These refusals preserve records, task, and HOME; they do not infer descendant
death from root death or grant termination authority over a recycled PID.

`descendant_termination_handles` checks every first-snapshot edge against exact
handle creation/exit times, then rechecks identity and lifetime bounds after a
second snapshot. If an observed intermediary exits and disappears from Toolhelp,
its pinned handle preserves the first edge only when the second identity read
confirms the same PID/creation time and a published exit time. A surviving child's
PPID must still agree; its creation time must precede that intermediary's exit.
Changed parent links and positively disproven identities/lifetimes are excluded.
Unknown is not an exclusion: an unopenable candidate must be absent from a fresh,
successful full process snapshot, or discovery raises `OSError`. Absence alone
is insufficient when that same fresh snapshot contains an entry referencing the
observed, now-vanished unopened parent: discovery refuses even if the child and
its descendants first appeared after the initial snapshot. This guard reports
only a total and at most three child/parent PID pairs, takes no extra snapshot,
and grants no identity or termination authority. A vanished unopened child with
no fresh descendant reference remains admissible.
A false `pid_exists` result is not sufficient because query denial can produce it too.
Unreadable opened/retained identities, missing live objects, and a surviving
child whose vanished unpinned parent has no lifetime proof also raise, so callers
must preserve HOME/task state rather than certify a partial tree as drained.
For an unopenable candidate still present in the fresh snapshot, the refusal
includes failure-only diagnostics for at most three candidates and eight PIDs
per first/fresh ancestry chain. The opener captures the immediate native error
(or Python exception type only); the report includes the root identity at scan
start and current identity/lifetime observations from already-pinned relevant
handles. A separate query-only handle may observe the candidate, but is always
closed and is explicitly unvalidated: no observation changes the refusal or
provides kill authority. Diagnostic failures leave the original refusal intact.
No command lines, environment, file contents, or unrelated process inventory
are emitted, and successful discovery does not collect or log this report.
All newly opened handles are closed on failure, including failures partway through
opening candidates; root and retained handles remain caller-owned. Positively
rejected newly opened handles are closed before returning the proven subset.

This covers an **already observed, handle-pinned** chain. An intermediary that died
before it was ever observed/pinned remains unverifiable; a single numeric snapshot
is not enough to recover that chain. The deterministic and self-owned native
regressions are in `test/test_platform_compat.py`, `TestProcessDescendants`.

## Verifying a change

CI holds all three platforms at the UNIT layer: the `backend-test` shards cover
Linux, `backend-test-windows` covers Windows, and `backend-test-macos` covers
macOS. All three run the whole suite, so a POSIX call that only works on Linux
goes red on the macOS shards rather than shipping. A shard passing is still not
evidence that a gateway starts: 25 whole files are excluded on Windows by
`test/windows-collect-ignore.txt` and further node ids by
`test/windows-expected-failures.txt` and `test/macos-expected-failures.txt`.
What runs a real gateway on macOS and Windows is `ci.yml`'s `e2e-boot-matrix`
job (`test/e2e/test_gateway_boot_matrix.py`), which boots one per test against
the packaged fake ACP backend and asserts a completed prompt turn. Point a
process or signal change at that job, not only at the shards. See
[../../ci/e2e-gate.md](../../ci/e2e-gate.md).

Still run process, signal, file-lock and metrics changes on macOS **and** Linux
locally where you can. A test that only ever runs on the author's platform is how
a silent no-op ships, and a CI red found after the push costs a round trip.

A test that cannot pass on macOS gets a precise
`skipif(sys.platform == "darwin", reason=...)` naming the capability, or its node
id in `test/macos-expected-failures.txt`, the burn-down list applied by the
rootdir `conftest.py`, same mechanism as `windows-expected-failures.txt`. Never
widen a platform assertion to make a red go away.

Frontend support is Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge, using standard Web APIs and
guarding the rest (`typeof Notification !== 'undefined'`).
