# Crew Log Projections

## 1. Purpose

A session's crew log is an append-only file (`crew-log-core.md`). Every view of it
is a FOLD: `status`, `usage`, `timeline`, `tools` and `approvals` -- the session
side panel of the RFC's section 5 table. This module is those five folds, the two
read routes that serve them, and the frame that pushes a fold when the file grows.

The split it implements is RFC NFR-2: the backend folds and cuts pages, the
frontend renders and pages and never folds. A client that folded the log would
need the whole file to show one number.

Scope: the SESSION kind. The crew-kind projections (`roster`, `activity`,
`board`, `budget`, ...) are out of scope here because the crew kind has no writer
yet, and a fold with no producer cannot be tested against anything real.

## 2. The fold contract

A projection is a value plus the `seq` it was folded through (FR-5). Two
projections of one unit are therefore comparable, and a client reconnecting
truncates against that number rather than guessing.

A fold is three pure pieces:

| piece | what it is |
|---|---|
| start | the state before any entry |
| step | one entry applied to the state, in place |
| render | the state as the value a reader is served |

`fold(name, entries)` is those pieces run over every entry. The INCREMENTAL form
is the primitive and the whole-file form is one line on top of it, so a resumed
answer and a from-scratch answer come out of one implementation. Two
implementations would be free to disagree about the same bytes, with nothing in
the file to say which is right.

`Checkpoint` is `(name, last_seq, state)` and is JSON-serializable, so a caller
may store it and continue later. The state is deliberately NOT the rendered
value: a fold keeps bookkeeping a reader has no use for -- the open tool calls it
is matching by `call_id`, the attempt an open turn is on -- and keeping the two
apart is what lets the value stay the surface the dashboard reads.

`advance(checkpoint, entries)` does not touch its input. It copies the state
first, because these are frozen records and a returned one sharing a mutable dict
with its input would leave that input claiming a seq its state has moved past.

**A replayed entry is refused, not skipped.** Every entry must have a seq
strictly above the last one consumed. The two plausible causes want opposite
handling and `advance` cannot tell them apart: a caller re-reading a page it
already folded would have its totals counted twice, and a caller holding a
checkpoint for a unit that was removed and recreated would have the whole new log
swallowed as already-folded. So it refuses with `bad_data` and naming the
collision, and `fold_session` handles the recreated-unit case itself by
discarding a bundle whose seq is ahead of the file. It also carries the log
file's creation identity (`SessionProjections.origin`, the header's `createdAt`)
and reuses a bundle only when that identity still matches: a log removed and
recreated that has already grown PAST the cached seq passes the seq guard, so
without the identity check its stale state would be folded onto a different
file's bytes. An unknown identity never matches, so an older bundle without the
field falls back to a full rebuild.

**Absent is never read as zero.** `turn/completed` carries `credits` and `tokens`
only on a provider-reported close, so a synthesized closer omits them. A total
that counted those turns as costing nothing would state a measurement nobody
made, so every total in `usage` rides beside the count of turns that contributed
to it (`turns.credits_reported`, `turns.tokens_reported`), and a caller comparing
the two learns what the total covers.

**Nothing is synthesized.** An interrupted turn and an unmatched tool call are
reported OPEN. Closing them is `CrewLog.open(repair=True)`, which appends real
deterministic closers under write ownership; a reader inventing the same fact in
memory would make two readers of one file disagree about one turn.

**An unpairable id is counted, never paired.** `tool/*.call_id` and
`approval/*.approval_id` may be empty, and an empty id identifies nothing --
keying a map by it would make every such call the same call, so one completion
would close a different call's frame. An id longer than `ID_LIMIT` takes the same
path for the same reason: it is retained, so its size is part of the bound, and it
cannot be shortened to fit because two distinct ids sharing a head would collapse
into one identity. Both sides of a pair coerce the id identically, so the call and
its completion always agree on what an identity is. Those are counted
(`tools.unidentified_calls`, `approvals.unidentified_requests`) and left unpaired.

**Every value is bounded, in count and in size.** A projection is pushed over a
socket on each growth, so its size cannot depend on how long the session ran:
`timeline` keeps the newest `TIMELINE_LIMIT` moments and reports how many it
dropped, `tools` details `TOOL_NAME_LIMIT` names while keeping the totals exact
and counting the rest in `names_omitted`, and the open-call and pending-approval
lists are capped with their own omitted counts. The bound is on the RETAINED
checkpoint state, not only the rendered value: a session that leaks never-matched
`call_id`s or `approval_id`s stops retaining them past `OPEN_RETAIN_LIMIT`
(counted in `open_dropped`/`pending_dropped`), a single tool called through many
servers caps its retained server names at `SERVERS_PER_TOOL_LIMIT` and counts the
DISTINCT omitted ones in `servers_omitted`, and `usage` details at most
`MODEL_LIMIT` models while keeping the whole-session totals exact and counting
the rest in `models_omitted` -- so the deep-copied, cached checkpoint cannot
grow without bound over a long-lived session.

A cap on HOW MANY values are retained bounds nothing on its own, because every
one of those values is a string off the wire. Every retained string is cut to
`TEXT_LIMIT` at the point the fold coerces it -- an approval's tool and reason, a
decision, a server, a tool or model name, and the `status` echoes of agent, owner,
slot, cwd, model, provider, stop reason and error -- so a handful of near-64-KiB
strings cannot outweigh the entry budget they are counted against. A field whose
ABSENCE is meaningful keeps it: a close reason, a stop reason and an error read as
`null` when unset rather than as a reason of no characters.

Cutting is safe only for a label that never distinguishes one thing from another.
A string used as a KEY is refused instead of cut: a label sitting exactly at
`TEXT_LIMIT` cannot be told apart from one that was cut, so keying on it would put
two unrelated tools (or models) in one row reporting each other's totals, which is
a wrong answer rather than a big value. `tools.by_name` and `usage.by_model`
therefore give no detail row to a label at that length, and it goes where a label
past the COUNT budget goes: the whole-session totals stay exact, and the label is
reported as omitted detail. An IDENTITY is refused for the same reason at
`ID_LIMIT`, and both sides of a pair coerce it identically so a call and its
completion never disagree about what an identity is.

A count of omitted detail is a count of THINGS, not of the events that mentioned
them: a tool name reaches that path from its call and again from its completion,
and a model reaches it once per turn it ran. Both counts are therefore
deduplicated against a list, that list is itself capped like everything else
retained here, and with the cap reached a label cannot be recognised as one
already counted. `names_omitted`, `models_omitted` and each tool row's
`servers_omitted` stop at the budget rather than climbing past the number of
labels that exist, and `names_omitted_saturated`, `models_omitted_saturated` and
`servers_omitted_saturated` say the figure has become a floor rather than a total.

**A cold fold holds a chunk, not the file.** Five folds consume the same entries,
so a single generator would be exhausted by the first of them and the span has to
be materialized. Materializing the WHOLE span is what a cold fold does most often
-- with no reusable bundle the range starts at seq 1, which is the ordinary first
read for any session -- so the pass is taken `FOLD_CHUNK_ENTRIES` at a time: one
pass over the file, with what is held bounded. Folding a span in pieces is the
same value as folding it whole, because `advance` is seq-anchored and each chunk
is strictly after the last, and each checkpoint takes only the part of a chunk it
has not already consumed -- which is what lets one chunk serve five folds sitting
at different seqs.

## 3. The five projections

| projection | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `status` | Is this session open, and what is it doing: lifecycle, the open turn and its attempt, agent/owner/slot/cwd, current model and provider, turns completed and refused, the last stop reason, dropped writes. |
| `usage` | What it spent: credits and the four token dimensions, per model; the per-turn context bill by source kind from `context/composed`; compaction count and the context they freed; step count and time. |
| `timeline` | The newest turn, lifecycle and cost MOMENTS, oldest first. Message, step and tool entries are deliberately absent: they are the bulk of a log, the page route and `tools` already serve them, and including them would make the timeline a second copy of the file. |
| `tools` | Calls matched to completions by `call_id`: totals, per name, open calls, unmatched completions. An error is `status` in `refused`/`error`/`failed` OR `is_error` true -- two independent signals, and an absent `is_error` is not a claim that the call worked. |
| `approvals` | Requests matched to decisions by `approval_id`: pending, decided, the decision tally, the last decision. No emitter writes these types yet; the fold is against the declared shape. |

## 4. Reads

| route | answers |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log?from=&to=` | The entries in a seq range, oldest first, with every `ref` on the page resolved (FR-4). |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projection/{name}` | One fold's `value` and the `seq` it folded through. |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projections` | Every fold, keyed by name, from ONE resolution and ONE pass over the unit, so a caller showing them together cannot be handed a mix from two units. Each fold keeps its own `seq`, which differs by design: an entry advances the folds it belongs to and leaves the rest. |

**The BATCH read answers two things the folds cannot.** A fold says what it holds;
it cannot say why it holds nothing, nor whether it was read mid-write. Both fields
are on `/crew-log/projections` alone, because both exist for a surface showing five
folds at once and no caller of the per-name route reads either -- and the settle one
of them needs is a wait charged to every request that carries it. The per-name and
page reads resolve their id the same way; they simply do not report these:

`resolved` -- whether a unit was NAMED for the id sent. An empty fold has two
causes that a reader must not be shown interchangeably: a session with no unit yet --
one that has not run a turn -- and one whose ACP session was torn down (an idle reset,
a model or agent switch, a compaction that recycles it) and whose entries are still on
disk under the retired id. Both arrive as `seq: 0`, so without this flag a surface
reporting "nothing recorded" states a cause as fact about the reader's own data. The
panel says the record is not addressable instead, and names both possibilities rather
than asserting the retired one.

This deliberately does NOT fall back to the persisted session map to find that
retired id. `SessionMap.get` repairs or removes an entry it judges stale, so
consulting it would make a panel READ mutate session state, which is the reason
`crew_log/resolve.py` documents for never touching it. And a retired unit belongs
to a session this slot no longer is: presenting its totals here would imply a
whole-life figure, which needs the lineage pointer (`session/opened.data.previous`)
and a fold that follows it -- neither exists yet (§8).

`writes_drained` -- whether the emitter owed nothing when the fold was taken. An
append is handed to a queue and the entry point returns, so a turn can END with its
last entries unwritten, and the refresh that turn's end triggers would fold a file
the turn has not finished writing. The batch read waits for `emit.flush` up to
`_SETTLE_SECONDS` first and reports which happened; false means the value may be
behind, which the footer says rather than presenting it as current. The wait is
global rather than per session because a batch the writer has already CLAIMED is
absent from the per-session queue and invisible there, so a session-scoped
predicate would report quiet in exactly the case that matters.

**`{id}` is a unit id OR a session key, and both reads resolve it the same way.**
A session's crew log is keyed by the ACP session id the turn path holds, and a
dashboard caller has no way to learn one: it is on no payload the client reads, and
putting it on the wire to let a client rewrite it into a path would widen what a
client is trusted with. So a key that the session registry recognises is resolved
to the unit it is serving through `crew_log.resolve.unit_for_session_key`, and an
id the registry does not recognise -- which is what an ACP id is, since it is not a
session key -- is used VERBATIM. That ordering is what keeps a unit-id-addressed
read working unchanged, and there are now two such callers on main: the
`kirocrew-crew-log` MCP server reads a unit by id through the unit-keyed door
described below, and the `session_projection` frame carries the unit it folded as
`session_id`, so anything taking an id out of a frame addresses by unit id too.
Both responses echo the id the CALLER sent, never the resolved one: a client polling
by key matches the answer to its request, and the internal identity stays off the wire.

**A slot key is resolved to the session its turns RUN on, not to itself.** A
channel-born slot runs its turns on the channel's own session and carries that key
in `linked_session_key` (`slack:<ts>`), so the ACP provider is registered under THAT
key. The resolver is an exact registry lookup whose one retry is the `dashboard:`
form, so a read that passed the bare slot key would miss the provider and fold an
empty record for every channel-linked session -- and never recover, because that
mapping is stable rather than racy. The read therefore asks
`chat_utils.effective_session_key`, the function that owns the mapping, before it
asks the resolver. That stays inside the invariant this path depends on: it is a pure
attribute read, with no disk and no session-state mutation. An id naming no live slot
passes through untouched, which is what an ACP unit id is.

Nothing enforces that a provider's session id can never equal a live session key --
the two are minted by different code -- so the ORDER is what decides a collision,
and it decides it in favour of the registry: an id the registry recognises is
resolved. That is the branch every chat read depends on, and a test pins it, so the
precedence is a decision rather than a side effect of the lookup's fallback.

The resolution is POINT-IN-TIME, and inherits exactly the guarantee
`crew_log/resolve.py` states: it answers which unit a key's work is landing in
*now*. A reset, an agent/model/effort switch, a compaction that recycles the ACP
session and a provider swap all start a new unit, so a key-addressed read after one
of those folds the CURRENT record and not the retired one -- totals drop, and
nothing in the answer says why. A key whose session was torn down and not
re-created resolves to nothing and reads back the empty fold at seq 0, which is the
same answer a session with no entries gets; the difference is not observable from
here. A reader that must span a slot's retired units needs the lineage pointer
(`session/opened.data.previous`) and a fold that follows it, which this module does
not do. The dashboard panel states the limit in its own footer rather than implying
a whole-life total.

Those two are the BROWSER's door: cookie auth, keyed on a session id the dashboard
already holds. A second, unit-keyed door serves the `kirocrew-crew-log` MCP server
over the same `read_page` and projection reads, on the strict internal transport
only: `GET /api/crew-log/sessions` lists units, `GET /api/crew-log/resolve` answers
which unit a caller's key lands in, and `GET /api/crew-log/units/{unit}/page` and
`/projection/{name}` are the unit-keyed forms of the two above. Their gate, and the
argument for granting them to an agent at all, is in
`docs/reference/crew-log/reading-from-an-agent.md`.

A page reports the tail it OBSERVED, not the one its handle remembers. `last_seq`
on a store handle is that handle's own cached figure -- authoritative only for its
own appends -- and a reader never appends, so a writer growing the file after the
handle opened is invisible to it. The pass over the file is live and walks the
whole tail from `from`, discarding what is past `to` rather than never seeing it,
so the real end is observable at no extra cost and both `last_seq` and `next_from`
come from it. Taking them from the cached figure instead would let a page return
rows up to `to` and still report that nothing follows, and a client that believes
it stops paging with entries left unread.

**A seq is only comparable within one file.** The push skips a projection whose
checkpoint has not moved, and a seq alone does not establish that: `fold_session`
refuses a bundle whose origin does not match the file and rebuilds from the start,
so a log removed and recreated can come back at the same terminal seq carrying
different values. The push compares the bundle's ORIGIN first and treats every
projection of a rebuilt bundle as new; comparing seqs alone would suppress every
frame and leave each client holding the retired file's projection, with no later
growth able to dislodge it.

**The push is a per-process singleton, so a restart rebinds it.** A second install
returns the same publisher, and rebinding only the event loop would leave it
holding the retired dashboard state: `_watchers` would count the old hub's sockets
and every frame would go to a room nobody is in, which reads exactly like a session
that quietly stopped updating. The rebind repoints both the loop and the state, and
clears the scheduling flags, which belong to the loop going away -- a timer armed
there never fires and a flush marked in flight there never finishes, so a stale
flag would silence the publisher permanently. The dirty set is kept: those sessions
did grow, the entries are on disk, and the next pass folds them forward.

The RFC spells the range route `/sessions/<id>/ledger`. The feature is named crew
log, and the dashboard mounts its API under `/api`, so the served path is
`/api/sessions/{id}/crew-log`.

A range wider than the store's page cap is CLAMPED rather than refused, and
`next_from` carries the rest: asking for a whole log is a reasonable question and
the answer is pages. `from` defaults to 1 and `to` to one default page.

A resolved ref carries the citation's VERDICT and span -- `{status, entries,
first_seq, last_seq}` -- and never the cited bytes. Those lines are a page of
their own unit, which this same route serves, and inlining them would let one
page carry up to `MAX_REF_SPAN` lines per entry. Identical refs on one page are
resolved once, and a page resolves at most `MAX_PAGE_REFS` distinct refs, past
which the entry keeps its `ref` with no resolution and the page reports
`refs_unresolved`.

**A page and a fold take opposite postures on a type they do not know**, and the
difference is deliberate. A fold passes its vocabulary to `iter_from`, so a
required unknown type raises `unknown_entry_type` (served as 409) rather than
letting the fold answer with a total that line may have changed. A page passes no
vocabulary: it renders history for a person, where an unfamiliar line is a
missing detail rather than a wrong answer, and refusing the page would hide the
history in front of it. That is the posture `crew-log-core.md` section 6 states for
`page` and `resolve`, applied to a range read.

A session with no crew log is not an error: the page reads as empty with
`exists: false`, and each projection is the empty one at seq 0. A session that
ran with `KIROCREW_CREW_LOG` off has none, and the panel renders without
first asking whether the file exists.

Both routes are gated on the DASHBOARD OWNER. `resolve` makes no authorization
claim, because the storage layer has no caller identity to derive one from, and
says the first caller with a permission model owns the question; these routes are
that caller. A crew log holds the session's message bodies, redacted but whole,
so the audience is the person the conversation belongs to.

## 5. The push

A `session_projection` frame carries `{session_id, name, seq, value}` and is sent
to OWNER sockets, matching the read gate: an app token is an authorized socket and
is not the conversation's owner.

The trigger is the emitter's growth signal. `crew_log.emit`'s write-behind
already groups a turn's burst into one drained batch, and
`add_growth_listener` reports that batch -- so a consumer is woken once per pass
rather than once per entry. The listener is REGISTERED rather than imported: the
emitter is imported by the dashboard, so calling a dashboard publisher from it
would close an import cycle and put a reader's name in the writer's code.

The publisher runs the reading half on the event loop, never on the writer
thread: `notify` hands the id to the loop and returns. It then coalesces for
`COALESCE_SECONDS`, folds all five projections from ONE incremental read of the
entries that arrived, and sends a frame only for a projection whose `seq` moved --
re-sending an unchanged value would spend a socket write to say nothing.

A flush pass runs to completion before the next one starts. A growth arriving
during a slow fold does not launch an overlapping pass: two `_publish` for one
session would otherwise share the same prior bundle and race the cache write, so
an older `seq` could be broadcast last. When a pass finishes with more work
marked, it schedules the next pass itself.

Fold state is cached for at most `MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS` sessions; an evicted
session folds from the start on its next growth. When no dashboard user has a
socket open the pass folds nothing, because the state stays cached and the next
growth continues from where it is, so skipping costs no accuracy.

The storage package is imported LAZILY by the handler module, never at import
time. The crew log is optional behind `KIROCREW_CREW_LOG`, this module sits
on the dashboard's boot path, and a gateway launched with the flag unset must not
pay to load a store it will not read -- the same split the emitter keeps, pinned
by a test that imports the module in a clean interpreter.

Installing the push is gated on the same flag, and gated BEFORE the emitter is
imported. `start_dashboard` calls the installer unconditionally, so asking the
emitter whether it is enabled would import it on every disabled launch -- which is
the cost the flag exists to avoid, not a check of it. The variable's name is
therefore spelled in this module and a test pins that spelling against the
emitter's own constant, so the duplication cannot drift unnoticed. With the flag
off the installer builds no publisher and registers no listener.

**A close does not close a turn.** A session cut off mid-turn writes
`session/closed` with no `turn/completed`, and the `status` fold leaves the open
turn standing. Clearing it would assert the turn finished when nothing recorded it
doing so, and would erase the one fact a reader wants from that log: this session
died with work in flight. A reader sees `closed_at` and the open turn together and
can tell exactly what happened. Only `turn/completed` closes a turn.

## 6. The session tree -- the one fold across logs

Every fold above reads its own unit's file and nothing else (FR-4). The session
tree (`crew_log/tree.py`) is the one reader that looks across logs, and it is a
different kind of thing on purpose: the `session_create` edge is recorded on the
CHILD (`crew-log-core.md` section 5), so "which session opened which" is not in
any one log. It is a fold over the collection, the shape dsh's `flattenLineage`
takes over its per-session `parentSession` header field: the record lives on the
child, the tree is a pure function over all the records, and an orphan or a cycle
degrades to root rather than to an error.

**What is read.** For every unit directory under the session root
(`store.unit_dirs`), the HEADER and the FIRST ENTRY of the oldest surviving
segment (`store.oldest_segment`, `store.read_head`) -- one bounded read per log
however long the session ran. That is enough: the emitter writes `parent` from a
process-local mint witness that exists before the child's first turn or never, so
the entry that created the log carries the parent whenever any entry does, and a
re-attach in the same process can only repeat it. A unit is refused the way
`unit_header_slot` refuses one -- a linked entry, a non-session header, a header
whose id does not fold back to its directory name -- and a header with no entry
behind it yet (the create landed, the announce has not) yields nothing and is
read again next scan rather than cached.

**The fold** (`fold_tree`, pure; input order does not matter):

| Case | Node |
|---|---|
| no record of the slot carries `parent` | root, `parent: None` |
| some record carries `parent` and a log with that slot exists | the edge is followed: the child nests under the creator |
| the cited slot has no log of its own (orphan) | root; `parent` kept as the citation |
| the edges close a cycle, or a slot cites itself | every member is marked `cycle: True` and nests nowhere; a slot hanging off a member keeps its edge to it |
| two records of one slot disagree | the OLDEST log's word stands (`createdAt`, then id); a slot that carries a `parent` at all is one `session_create` minted (`chat-<N>-<ts>`: a monotonic counter plus the unix second, the counter reseeded past every restored key at boot), so such a key is never a dead session's recycled one, and the oldest word is the creation's own |
| a record with no slot in its header | dropped -- it has no place in a slot-keyed tree |

A record without `parent` never retracts one: create -> re-attach (with parent)
-> gateway restart -> re-attach (no parent, the witness is gone) folds to the
parent the first log recorded, and so does a slot whose later logs were opened
after a restart. The tree is keyed by slot and reads `parent.slot` only:
`parent.sid` on the entry is the creator's ACP session id at the moment of
creation, an audit citation for a reader of the logs themselves (`crew-log-core.md`
section 5), and a slot outlives its ACP session, so it is not what a live row
nests on. Nothing reads it today; a reader that shows a session's own log would.

**The cache, and its bound.** `SessionTree` keeps one head per unit directory,
validated per scan against the segment path and its `(st_dev, st_ino)`. No mtime:
the store never rewrites a written line, so the two lines a scan reads are
immutable for as long as the segment exists, and an mtime key would re-read a live
session's log on every append. An untouched unit costs one `stat`; a segment that
is gone (retention, removal) or replaced (a new inode under the same name) is
re-read; a unit that yields nothing is dropped from the cache. A read that fails
outright (an `OSError` after the `stat` succeeded: a moment's I/O fault, or a unit
retention removed between the two calls) is no verdict on the bytes, so nothing is
cached for it: the next scan reads the unit again, or finds it gone and evicts it.
A cached failure would hide that session's creator until the segment rolled or
the process restarted.

A scan ADMITS at most `TREE_UNIT_CAP` (4096) units, and the cap cuts EVERY loop
of the scan, not only what it retains: the live sessions' logs are probed first
(the sampler names them by ACP session id, `store.unit_dir_for`, one `stat`
each, through `islice(preferred, cap)` so absent ids cost no more than the cap
in probes); the store's listing (`store.unit_dirs`, in the directory's own
order, excluding what is already admitted) fills the rest of the cap and stops
one candidate past it; the cache holds one head per admitted unit; and every
string a head retains is bounded at admission (`MAX_ACP_SESSION_ID_LEN` for the
id, `MAX_SHORT_STRING` for the slot keys; an oversize value refuses the unit
rather than truncating to a key that matches nothing). What lies past the cap is
neither walked, read, cached nor counted -- counting it would mean walking the
population, which is the cost the bound refuses -- and THAT something lies past
it lands in `SessionTree.over_cap`, reported on every payload as
`totals.lineage_over_cap` beside `totals.lineage_cap` (the constant, so the
page can say "4,096+"). The Sessions table's footer shows that as an ordinary
stat, "Stored session logs", not in the page's warn colour, only while it is
true: it removes no row from the page, so it is information about the store, and
its label names logs on disk because the strip already counts sessions, task
sessions and session procs, and a fifth "session" figure would read as a fifth
live count. Its hint names the cap itself ("more than 4,096 exist", the value
interpolated from `totals.lineage_cap`), since the bubble opens away from the
stat it explains, and leads with what it means (old logs are piling up), says
what it can cost the page (below), names where its remedy is typed ("in a
terminal run:"),
and what to do (the `kirocrew config set` command for the retention setting,
named as the one switch that also expires the transcripts the Archive page
lists, since `store.sweep_expired` runs off the same value), stating no default,
since the default lives in `config/sections.py` and prose restating it would go
stale silently. Because the live logs go first, what the cap leaves unread is
closed sessions' logs, and a live row nests on one of those in exactly one
case: a slot that outlived a gateway restart, whose current log was opened
without a `parent` (the witness is gone) and whose creator is named only by its
older, closed log -- a unit that competes in directory order like any other and
can fall past the cap. Such a row folds as a root while the store is over the
cap, which is why the hint says a session restarted since it was opened may show
as top-level instead of under its opener, rather than that nothing on the page is
affected. The hint also says what the retention command removes and keeps, since
a reader who fears losing transcripts will not run it: only closed sessions' logs
and the old saved transcripts (the rotated archives) older than the days set go; running sessions
and anything newer stay (`store.sweep_expired` removes only a unit whose close is
terminal; `history._cleanup_old_archives` deletes only rotated archive files). The
Storage screen's age sweep is not the remedy for this pile: it moves transcripts
and kiro-cli replay logs to the Trash and never touches a crew-log unit, so a hint
that sent the reader there would promise a shrink that does not happen. Every
other live row folds, over the cap or not -- with one bound: the preferred set
is capped too, so a gateway running more live logged sessions than the cap
loses lineage on the rows past it. A unit that fell past the cap because the
population changed is evicted like a removed one. What a poll costs at the cap,
measured on a local disk with 4,096 units: the cold first scan (one root
listing, one listing and one head read per unit) took 376 ms; a warm scan (the
root listing, one listing and one `stat` per unit, every head from the cache)
took 90-120 ms, and the fold on top of it is within that. The sampler runs the
scan on the executor beside its other filesystem work, and the page polls every
5 s, so a store at the cap costs about 2% of one core while the Sessions tab is
open and nothing while it is not. The cap is far above any population retention leaves; a
store that reaches it usually has retention disabled, though a store with more
than that many unexpired logs reaches it too. `test_crew_log_tree.py` measures
the invariant rather than reading it off the code: a scan handed ten times the
cap in absent ids makes exactly the cap's worth of probes, a store three times
the cap is examined for cap + 1 candidates, and the cache never exceeds the cap.

The scan is blocking and runs where the sampler's other filesystem work runs, on
the subprocess executor, never on the event loop. A scan that raises is logged and
reported as an empty tree: the tree decorates the pages that show it, and a store
fault must not take them down.

**The wire.** Each session row of `GET /api/sessions/memory` carries `parent`:
`null` for a session nobody created, otherwise `{slot, key}` -- the cited creator
slot, and `key` the creator's LIVE session key when the creator is running and the
edge can be followed (`null` for a creator that is not running, a node on a cycle,
or a citation pointing at the row itself). The join from a log's slot to a live
row is by slot key alone: a dashboard row's key is `dashboard:{slot.key}` and its
log -- and any child citing it -- carries the bare `slot.key`. `totals` carries
`lineage_over_cap` and `lineage_cap` (above); the sampler hands the tree the live
rows' ACP session ids (`runtime_pids` carries each as `sid`, bounded by
`MAX_ACP_SESSION_ID_LEN` at retention) so those logs are read first. The Memory column's hint says each row is its own runtime's figure, a parent's figure does not include the rows nested under it, and a group's header row under Group by is the one row that does total (TanStack's sum aggregation on the grouped column, which is the base table's behaviour), so the reader is not left to guess which bold rows sum. A task row carries a muted "task" marker before its name: once created sessions nest too, indent alone no longer says which kind an indented row is, and the kind otherwise showed only on hover (a session's name underlines, a task's does not). A folded session's count is the visible text "M MB in N hidden rows", unit included and the memory bound to the rows in the words (beside the parent's own Memory cell a bare "N rows, M MB" left the reader unsure which figure was whose): it counts sessions and tasks, where the footer's "nested" counts sessions only, and a bare numeral beside that reads as either; the memory is the hidden rows' own figures summed, carried on the badge because a folded parent's figure is its own and without the roll-up beside it the fold reads as a family total (a row with no memory data contributes nothing, and a fold with none shows the count alone). The
System page's Sessions table nests a session under `parent.key` exactly as it
nests a task under its `parent`, to whatever depth the creating went, with a task
under whichever session spawned it wherever that session sits; a created session
whose creator is not running is a top-level row that still carries its citation.
A row nested under its creator needs no further citation: its place in the tree
is one, and the creator's expander names the relation ("Collapse sessions under
{name}"). A created row that could NOT be nested (creator not running, a cycle)
says who opened it as VISIBLE text under its name -- "Created by {creator} (not
running, so shown top-level)", the creator's display name when it has a live row, else the slot the
log cited; the parenthetical names the one reason a created row is top-level
that real creation order can produce (a cycle is the other, and cannot arise
from ``session_create``, which never lets a child create its own ancestor) --
never as a native `title`: a keyboard or touch reader sees no tooltip, and this
row has nothing else that says it. The table re-checks the edge it is handed --
a key naming no row in the payload, or a chain returning to its own start --
because a table must never fail to paint on a payload it did not produce.

## 7. Deliberately not here

- **Checkpoints on disk** (`projections/<key>.json`). State is kept in memory,
  keyed by session, and the shape is already the one a checkpoint file would
  carry, so persistence is additive.
- **Crew-kind folds.** No crew writer exists.
- **Subagent lineage and fork pointers.** A `subagent/spawned` entry's `ref` is
  resolved on the page like any other citation. The session tree (section 6)
  folds the `session_create` edge only: a `spawn_run` subagent has no session
  log of its own to record a parent on, and a fork stamps no creator.
- **SPA rendering.** The frame shape is specified here so the client can follow.
- **`turn/completed` carrying `attempt`.** It does not, so a fold cannot pair a
  completion with its start by field. The pairing is positional: a `turn/started`
  opens the current attempt at that ordinal and the next `turn/completed` for it
  closes whatever is open, which is what the file supports.
