"""Pure helpers for the ssh self-target floor's hosts-file table.

The line parser that turns hosts-file text, fed one chunk at a time, into
``{name -> maps-to-local}``, the content digest a Windows cache key carries,
and the two exceptions the reads raise.  ``argv_floor`` owns every read, the
cache and the gate; these live apart so that parsing plumbing does not count
against that module's per-module liveness cap.

Layer.  This module imports nothing from the package: ``argv_floor`` imports
these names and re-binds them in its own namespace, which is the seam tests
monkeypatch.
