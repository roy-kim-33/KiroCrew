    what the default agent carries once a rebuild has widened it — covers the

    A whole-server grant on an excluded server is therefore replaced by the SHIPPED
    TEMPLATE's own per-tool grants for that server. Those per-tool refs are the

    one place instead of enumerating a server's surface here, where a verb added to
    the server tomorrow would silently join the worker's allowlist. It also fails

    prompting rather than auto-approved.

    The pass is applied after every source has been folded in, so a ref that arrives
    from the previous worker file is excluded on the same terms as one mirrored from
    the default. That is deliberate: this is a policy about what a worker may skip
    the gate for, not a preference the file it was written into can overrule.

    Deduplicates while it filters, so a default carrying both the whole-server grant

    describe a different generation than the one that was attributed.

    PROVENANCE, not existence, and the distinction is the whole point. Existence is

    derivation did not write is not stale against the default: replacing it destroys

    ``None`` -- meaning "ours to write" -- covers three states, and the third is

    * the file is ABSENT, so there is nothing to attribute;
    * it carries both marks every derivation writes (see below);
    * it does not parse as an agent spec object at all. A broken file at this path

      A bundle's spec is digest-verified before install and therefore parses, so this

    The two marks are the declared ``name`` and a reference to the ``kirocrew-work``
    server -- the mount that IS this agent, and the reason it exists at all. Both have
    been written by every release that produced a mirror, which is what keeps an

    left by an older build is HEALED rather than needing a hand-edit, and a mark chosen
    from the current spec's shape (the exact prompt, the mounted server map) would
    refuse those files instead of repairing them. So the reference is accepted wherever
    a release put it -- the server map, ``tools``, or a per-tool grant.

    Neither mark is a secret and a spec could forge them; forging them volunteers the
    forger's own file to be replaced, which costs nothing. What cannot happen is the

        The SUPERSET of the default agent, which is the whole distinction worth
        keeping: everything the default agent already grants, plus the opt-in
        ``kirocrew-work`` server, plus a prompt carrying the reporting contract. A
        NARROWED worker spec was considered and rejected — a worker writes files, runs
        builds and drives git, so anything a narrowed spec withheld would be something
        some work item needs, which is the same defect an omitted ``agent`` on
        ``session_create`` produces by handing the child ``kirocrew-conductor``
        (no ``fs_write``, cannot do the work).

        "The default agent" is the spec ON DISK, not the template it was assembled
        from — :func:`_installed_default_spec` says why that difference is the whole
        point. The keys in :data:`_WORKER_MIRRORED_KEYS` are mirrored from it and the
        work server plus its two grants are added on top, so a server the user mounts,
        a grant they add and the model they pick all reach the worker on the next
        refresh, while a tool the ceiling withholds on the default stays withheld here.

    TWO things are SUBTRACTED rather than inherited, and both exist because the
        mirror would otherwise widen a worker's reach on its own. The cron grants in
        :data:`_WORKER_EXCLUDED_GRANTS` — a recurring job outlives the item, the session
        and the dispatch, so a worker does not auto-approve authoring one (see that
        constant for why those three verbs and not the reading ones, and why the tool
        stays mounted). And the servers :func:`_worker_unassignable_servers` names — an
        ``opt_in`` set is assigned per agent, so one the operator mounted on their own
        agent is not thereby assigned to every worker they dispatch. The whole spec is
        ``default + @kirocrew-work − cron scheduling − the opt-in sets nobody assigned
        here``.

        The spec is otherwise a FUNCTION of those inputs, and the previous worker file
        contributes exactly one field to it: a ``model`` the user froze with an explicit
        pick. Carrying anything else forward was tried and removed. The worker file is
        derived, so an entry in it is either a copy of the default's or the user's own and
        nothing on disk says which — and an add-only merge therefore resurrects a server
        the default has since DROPPED (register an app, deregister it, and its tools stay
        callable on the worker for good) while also re-admitting an ``autoApprove`` no
        ceiling has seen. Preserving a user's worker-file edits is worth doing, but it
        needs a provenance record this change does not introduce.

        ``work_brief`` and ``work_report`` are auto-approved because a worker that must
        ask permission to say it is blocked will not say it, and an unattended
        dispatch is exactly the case the ledger exists for. Every grant on the
        assembled list — template, mirror, preserved or added here — passes the
        governance ceiling in ONE final filter, so a host that governs a ref gets a
        prompt rather than a bypass.

    ONE caller in the product: the spawn-path freshness gate

    **Must not be called while holding ``bridges._mcp_lock``.** The installer takes
    ``agents_spec_lock`` and then that lock, in that order, so a caller holding it

    does so after its own MCP transaction has committed and released.
