kiro-cli refuses a server key containing ``/``, so :func:`_normalize_mcp_server_keys`
moves such a server under its slash-free alias and carries its ``@`` references with

each rebuild, and refusing to let a grant move onto a name a different server holds.

:func:`_apply_connection_tool_aliases` resolves tool-name collisions between exposed

    """Resolve exposed-provider tool-name collisions into ``config['toolAliases']``.

    Without this, two exposed providers that ship the same tool name leave one of
    the two unreachable -- kiro-cli addresses a tool by bare name, so the later
    mount shadows the earlier one silently.

    :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.tool_aliases` owns invariants 1-6, which decide
    WHICH aliases resolve (registry-sourced, collision-only, exposed-and-verified
    providers). The THREE below are this function's, and govern how a resolution
    is written into a spec that a user also edits:

    * **Flag off => byte-identical emission.** The key is neither created nor
      cleared, so a spec built with the gate off is indistinguishable from one
      built before this pass existed. Nothing else here reads ``toolAliases``,
      so leaving a stale key alone cannot mislead a later pass -- and clearing it
      would make "off" a distinct third behaviour instead of a no-op. A no
      collision resolution likewise writes nothing, so the common install (zero
      or one exposed provider) gains no empty object.

    * **The generated subset is read from a PERSISTED record, not inferred from a
      pair's shape.** Cleanup deletes entries out of a file the user also edits, so
      it needs proof of authorship, and no property of the NAME supplies one: a
      ``<slug>_`` prefix test claims a hand-written ``linear_issues``, and
      re-deriving ``<slug>_<tool>`` claims a hand-written ``notion_search`` for a
      provider that declares nothing. So the pass records exactly what it emitted
      and, on the next run, strips only pairs that record claims (whole triple,
      so a user-edited generated alias does not match and survives). Merging
      onto the previous output instead would make "user-authored wins" preserve
      the LAST rebuild's generated refs: the merge is idempotent, so a rename
      would survive the mount that justified it going away. Every pair the record
      does not claim is by definition the user's and still wins over the registry
      default. See :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.alias_record` for the generation
      binding that stops the record ever describing a spec it does not match: this
      function OPENS the transaction, so an interrupted rebuild is recoverable from
      whichever side actually reached disk, and the CALLER commits it once the spec
      is durable.

    * **A generated alias never lands on a name already in use.** The destination
      is checked against surviving alias targets, the declared natural names of
      exposed providers, every tool name named in a per-tool ``tools`` ref of ANY
      exposed server (custom servers included), and the builtin names in
      ``tools``; a conflict skips that one alias with a warning. Renaming onto an
      occupied name would recreate the shadowing this pass exists to remove, so it
      fails safe to shadowing rather than to a silent overwrite. A custom server
      mounted WHOLE publishes its names only at runtime and is out of scope by
      construction -- see the module docstring's OUT OF SCOPE note.

    Mutates *config* in place. Idempotent: the resolution is a pure function of
    the exposed provider set, so a rebuild that changes no mounts rewrites the
    same map (or leaves the same absence).

    Args:
        config: The assembled spec. Mutated in place.
        claimed: The triples the record proves THIS pass wrote into the generation
            *config* currently carries, already resolved by the caller against the
            authoritative on-disk map. Empty means nothing is provably ours, so
            every existing pair is treated as the user's and survives.

    Returns:
        ``(fingerprint, emitted)`` for the generation this pass just wrote into
        *config* -- the fingerprint of the resulting ``toolAliases`` map and the
        ``(slug, tool, alias)`` triples it emitted, possibly EMPTY (an empty
        emission is how the pass relinquishes pairs it does not write). The

        it after. ``None`` means the pass did not run -- gate off, no server map, or

    concrete mount alias so later ownership decisions survive collision suffixing.
    Migrates already-broken existing configs. Idempotent: slash-free keys are left
    untouched and a re-merged duplicate collapses onto the canonical alias (no churn).

    ``reserved_keys`` names known-but-absent servers. Their refs are left
    exactly as they are: no present key's per-tool prefix rewrite may capture
    one, and nothing moves one onto an alias this function may hand to a live

    grants this pass drops for a reserved-alias collision; rewrites and duplicate

    Dedup is by *normalized* spec (:func:`_norm_mcp_spec`), so a re-added key

    ``config`` is assembled from a spec read taken BEFORE the write lock, so its
    alias map can be a stale generation by the time the write happens. Two
    overlapping rebuilds serialize their spec writes but not that read: the second
    would otherwise write its pre-lock snapshot back, resurrecting aliases the
    first had removed, and would fingerprint a generation that is gone.

    So the map is re-read here, inside the critical section that writes it, and
    that value is what the alias pass resolves against (alias_record invariant 7).
    It runs whether or not the alias pass will: a gate-off or fail-closed rebuild
    would write the stale snapshot just the same. A CLEAN rebuild is the one
    exemption and the caller makes it -- clean regenerates from defaults, so
    importing the old spec's map would defeat the reset (see the call site).

    A MISSING spec is not an invalid one. With no file there is no durable
    generation to reconcile against, so the assembled map stands: a first install
    whose ``agent.json`` carries a hand-written ``toolAliases`` would otherwise
    have it erased before it was ever written. Only a spec that EXISTS decides the
    map -- a dict is imported, and an absent or non-dict value clears the key,
    because kiro-cli rejects the whole spec over a non-dict ``toolAliases`` and
    re-importing one would carry the broken file forward and cost the user every
    tool. Dropping it here repairs it even when the alias pass never runs.

    Uses the file being written rather than a fixed path, so it is correct on the
    canonical spec (where the caller holds the lock) and on any other spec the
    rebuild targets.

    Returns:
        True when a spec existed on disk and therefore decided the map; False when
        there was none and *config* was left exactly as assembled.
