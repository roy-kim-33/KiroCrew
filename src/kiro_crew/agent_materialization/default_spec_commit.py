    untouched, apply and strip alike: a server the user hand-authored at a

    ``oauth.clientId``/``clientSecret`` -- holds the only copy of that client in
    a file the rebuild merges onto, so stripping it here would destroy it and
    overwriting it would swap the user's app for the operator's. The same
    verbatim-preservation rule every other unmanaged wire value gets applies.

    For a managed server, a no-op unless it is a registry provider in
    ``auth.mode = "preregistered"`` at the registry's own URL; for such a
    provider the operator has not configured yet the entry is emitted with the
    three owned keys removed (a cleared client must not survive the merge onto
    the previous spec) and kiro-cli's own DCR attempt fails against the vendor
    exactly as it would today, while the card already says why. When configured,
    the client id, the secret (confidential clients) and the pinned redirect URI
    are written into kiro-cli's ``oauth`` block; see
    ``kiro_crew.connections.oauth_clients`` for the custody argument, in short:
    the vault is the source of truth and this file is a projection of it, the
    same footing ``headers`` secrets already have here.
