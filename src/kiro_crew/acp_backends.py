"""Which ACP backends this build can serve — the one place that decides.

The question this module owns is **capability**: can this build drive the harness
at all? The public edition registers kiro-cli and KAS; an edition plugin adds its
own from ``ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends`` by calling
:func:`register_selectable_backend`, the structural twin of
``publish_provider.register_provider``.

A LEAF module on purpose. ``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` imports the ACP client and
runtime, so reaching ``kiro_crew.acp.types`` executes that package init and lands
back in ``config.loader`` — the cycle ``_normalize_acp_backend`` used to defer for.
That cycle is why the selectable list used to be a **literal in three unrelated
places** (the loader's ``acp_backend`` field metadata, the dashboard's PATCH
allowlist, and ``acp.types``) with a drift test standing in for a code owner: none
of the three could import the others. Nothing here imports ``kiro_crew.acp``,
``kiro_crew.config`` or ``kiro_crew.platform``, so all three now derive from this
module — and a plugin-registered backend reaches the dashboard without a core
edit, which a literal could never do.

Whether a registered backend may be selected on a *given deployment* is a separate
question (an enterprise policy bounding the fleet to one harness). It is
deliberately NOT answered here: it needs a governance ceiling, resolving a ceiling
reaches ``current_context()``, and that call's lazy branch loads config — so asking
it from :func:`resolve_selected_backend`, which runs inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, re-enters that load and recurses. Keeping this module
capability-only is what makes the load path safe.

# ── The selectable registry ──

#: What the public edition ships.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` is included because the public build can genuinely serve a
#: session with it: ``acp/client.py`` owns the whole spawn path (the ``_is_claude``
#: branch, ``_resolve_claude_acp_bin``, ``_resolve_claude_code_executable``) and the
#: adapter it needs is a PUBLIC npm package (``CLAUDE_ACP_NPM_PKG``). Nothing about it
#: is edition-private. An earlier revision left it out and described it as a "dormant
#: seam ... not something a public build can serve a session with", which made the
#: option render as permanently unavailable on exactly the builds that could run it —
#: the switch was the only missing piece, not the harness.
#:
#: Whether it is USABLE on a given machine is a separate question with its own answer:
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install` probes for the two binaries and the
#: dashboard reports what is absent plus the command that installs it.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`` is deliberately absent, and for a reason that does NOT apply
#: to claude: the spawn path lands here, but no provider registers it and
#: ``backend_install`` has no probe for its adapter, so a build offering the option
#: could not tell an operator what is missing when the session failed to start. It
#: becomes selectable when something calls :func:`register_selectable_backend` —
#: adding it here instead would ship an option ahead of the code that answers for it.
