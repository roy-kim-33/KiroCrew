"""W01 · L01: the RUN-01 typed error taxonomy for connector operations.

RUN-01 is the campaign's unified typed error taxonomy -- the twelve-value closed
set ``connector-capability-manifest.md`` names for the ``W05 -> W06`` edge:
``auth`` / ``scope`` / ``consent`` / ``not_found`` / ``forbidden`` / ``quota`` /
``throttle`` / ``conflict`` / ``input`` / ``temporary`` / ``partial`` /
``ambiguous``. Every provider stream classifies its failures against THIS set,
so a governance hook and a retry policy switch on one vocabulary instead of each
stream re-deriving its own -- which is exactly the string-sniffing anti-pattern
(``l1_smoke._RECONSENT_TOKENS`` matching ``"unauthorized"`` / ``"forbidden"`` in
a free-text message) RUN-01 exists to replace. Reconnecting that classifier to
RUN-01 is a SEPARATE later slice; this module only fixes the taxonomy it will
target, and does not touch ``l1_smoke``.

The twelve values are a closed set copied verbatim from the manifest. This slice
neither invents a thirteenth nor drops one; a genuinely new failure class is a
scoped revision of the manifest's own list, under its owning-spec rule.

Redaction discipline for ``detail``
-----------------------------------
A typed error carries a short, human-readable ``detail``, and that string can
reflect text a provider returned. It therefore goes through the SAME redaction
discipline every other error surface in this subsystem uses -- redact THEN
truncate, capped at the same 200 characters ``l1_smoke._redacted_detail`` caps
at (``_MAX_ERROR_CHARS = 200``). :func:`redacted_detail` is the one way to
build a ``detail``, so this module opens no new un-redacted error-text channel:
it delegates to :func:`kiro_crew.security.redact_and_truncate`, the in-repo
primitive that runs the site-wide credential / exfiltration-URL scanners over
the whole string before slicing it (truncating first would bisect a credential
straddling the boundary and leak the prefix past the regex -- the exact reason
``_redacted_detail`` redacts before it truncates).
