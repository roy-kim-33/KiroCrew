"""Which backend projects the agent spec how — as a typed declaration, per backend.

The point of a registry rather than a lookup that returns ``None`` on a miss is
that **absence has to be a statement**. A backend with no entry here fails the
parity test; a backend that genuinely needs no projection says so, in a record a
test can read.

A free-text reason was not enough to carry that distinction. "Declared not to
need one" and "nobody got round to it" were both spelled as a paragraph of prose
under one name, so a selectable backend could sit there with an explanation of
why its projection had not been written and every check stayed green. That is the
structural reason the same missing-tools defect shipped on four harnesses in a
row. :class:`McpProjection` replaces the paragraph with a KIND, and the kinds
that are not finished states carry the fields that make them addressable — what
would have to exist, and where the work is tracked.

The declaration lives here rather than in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`,
which owns the capability sets, for one mechanical reason: that module is a leaf
that imports neither ``kiro_crew.acp`` nor ``kiro_crew.providers``, and
``config.loader`` reaches it from inside ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``. A table
naming this folder's mirror classes would put that cycle back. The projection
vocabulary (:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Concern`,
:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Disposition`) already lives in this
folder, so the declaration that selects between them belongs beside it.
