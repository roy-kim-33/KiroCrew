"""Who serves a pod's port: gateway PID attestation against the service manager.

# Port ownership — WHO answers the pod's port, not merely whether anyone does.
#
# A pod's port is derived, not allocated: `base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1` maps
# every pod name into 199 slots, and `PORT=` in the per-pod env file can pin any
# port by hand. So two pods colliding on one port is an ordinary event, and the
# live gateway is reachable on the same loopback interface. Whoever binds first
# wins; the loser's gateway exits "address already in use" and the unit
# crash-loops behind it.
#
# A bare `GET /api/health` cannot tell those apart. `{"ok": true}` is the same
# answer from any Kiro Crew gateway on the host, and its identity fields say
# `app=kirocrew` plus a version — true of the squatter as well. Reading a 200 as
# "this pod is up" therefore reports a crash-looping pod as healthy and points
# the operator's browser at somebody else's instance.
#
# `instances/run_marker` states the rule this module was breaking: it
# "deliberately does not offer a bare 'is something listening' helper, so no
# caller can mistake reachability for identity". The pod probe is now held to it
# — the reachability probe is private and every caller goes through `health`.

    The proof is agreement between two independent pod-owned facts: the gateway
    PID sidecar in the pod's isolated ``0700`` home and the service manager's
    current ``MainPID`` (or launchd PID). The pod unit is ``Type=simple`` and
    execs the gateway in place, so that PID is the process that bound the port,
    and the sidecar is written only AFTER that bind succeeds. A pod that lost
    the bind race therefore has no agreeing record to offer.

    That agreement is only worth anything because the record proves its own
    freshness: :func:`_pod_recorded_pid` answers with a pid ONLY when the
    process it names still has the start-time identity the record was written
    with, so a sidecar left behind by a crash cannot attest once its pid has
    been recycled. Without that binding the number alone could name somebody
    else, which is the only reason listener attribution was ever load-bearing.

    Listener attribution is CORROBORATION, not a precondition. Its view is
    scoped to the 127.0.0.1 listener the HTTP client reaches, so a pid on the
    port that is not ours is positive proof of a foreign responder and outranks
    any record. But when the host has no usable listener evidence -- no lookup
    tool, a lookup that failed, or a lookup that simply could not see the socket
    -- a provably fresh PID-record/MainPID agreement is sufficient. That is the
    normal supported path on a minimal Linux host, and on any host where the
    caller cannot see another process's sockets (an unprivileged process asking
    ``lsof`` about a gateway started by the user's service manager, which is
    exactly how ``pod api`` runs). Requiring attribution there would withhold
    the credential from every healthy pod forever.

    Listener attribution is still never sufficient ON ITS OWN: a pid that holds
    the port but has no fresh record behind it stays :data:`OWNER_UNPROVEN`.

    **Windows reaches this the same way**, which it did not before pods had a
    backend there. The proof needs exactly two things, and both now answer on
    win32: ``run_marker.pid_start_token`` has a Windows leg (the process creation
    ``FILETIME``, read through a query-only handle), and :func:`main_pid` reads the
    pid ``windows.supervise_gateway`` records. Keeping the old blanket refusal here
    would not have been strictness, it would have been unsatisfiable — ``pod up``
    mints a token and :func:`mint_token` requires positive proof, so every healthy
    Windows pod would have been refused its own credential forever. Listener
    corroboration works there too (``netstat`` via ``trusted_system_bin``).

    **On Windows the recorded pid and the binding pid are different processes, and
    both are the pod.** A pip console script is an ``.exe`` launcher stub that
    starts the interpreter as a child and waits, so ``supervise_gateway`` records
    the stub while that child binds the port, and the gateway's own pid sidecar
    names that child. The Windows leg therefore reads the stub's descendants once
    (:func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.process_descendants`) and accepts them in
    both places the proof compares pids: the sidecar's pid attests when it is the
    stub or one of its descendants, and a listener inside that tree corroborates.
    That widens the accepted set DOWNWARD only: a sidecar or a listener outside
    this pod's tree still fails exactly as before.

    **Every edge of that tree is attributed by creation order, or the widening
    would point the wrong way.** Windows never invalidates a snapshot's
    ``th32ParentProcessID`` when the parent dies, so once that number is recycled
    to the stub, processes the stub never spawned are listed beneath it — and a
    FOREIGN listener inside such a phantom subtree would be read as this pod
    holding its own port, which is the single question this function answers.
    :func:`kiro_crew.pod.windows.created_after` is the rule, shared with
    ``windows.stop`` so the two call sites cannot drift apart, and a candidate
    whose creation time cannot be read is dropped as unattributable — failing
    toward ``OWNER_FOREIGN`` / ``OWNER_UNPROVEN`` rather than toward a false claim
    of ownership.
