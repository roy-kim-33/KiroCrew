"""Pod runtime core, and the ``kiro_crew.pod.runtime`` compatibility facade.

The core is what every other pod runtime owner builds on, and what repository gates
pin to this file: pod names and errors, the per-pod env file, git worktree
resolution, a pod's identity paths, the ``systemd --user`` adapter with the platform
dispatch in front of launchd and Task Scheduler, the per-name and plane-wide
lifecycle locks, seed sanitization, the pod gateway's environment, and the
owner-only directory helper. Everything that talks to the host lives in the pod
runtime so :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.cli` stays a thin verb layer, and no state is held:
each function reads what it needs from a :class:`PodConfig`.

The other owners import this core. The core imports them in turn only at the end
of its own body, once every name of its own is bound:

* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_ports` -- port derivation and allocation
* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_attestation` -- who serves a pod's port
* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_client` -- health, credential mint, authenticated API
* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_home` -- seeding, the OS home, HOME reclamation
* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_lifecycle` -- start, stop, backend install
* :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime_boot` -- boot, ``pod exec``, terminal refusals

Every name listed in :data:`_EXPORTS_BY_OWNER` is also reachable here: a read of
``kiro_crew.pod.runtime.<name>`` resolves on the owner, and a write or delete -- a
test's monkeypatch -- is forwarded to it, so the pod CLI, Dev Fleet and the pod
suite keep reaching one namespace. A name an owner adds is reachable here only once
it is listed in that table. A module the pod runtime imports (``time``,
``launchd``, ``pinned_fs``, ...) is one shared object, so patch its attributes
(``rt.time.sleep``). Rebinding the module name is refused, because each importing
module holds its own binding of it. See the facade at the end of this module.

# make completeness checkable against one document instead of guessing again.
# `/lib/systemd/system` is not in Table 1; it is the pre-usr-merge location of
# `/usr/lib/systemd/system` and is kept for split-usr hosts.

# The order decides only WHICH path a message names, because presence is "any one
# of these exists". Naming the highest-precedence hit is the accurate choice.
#
# Known limitations, both from reading the load path rather than asking systemd
# for it. A MASKED template (an entry symlinked to `/dev/null`) reads as present,
# because `os.path.exists` follows the symlink and `/dev/null` exists; reporting
# that correctly needs real shadowing semantics, where a mask in a
# high-precedence directory suppresses a lower-precedence unit. And a host that
# sets `$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH` moves the load path out from under this list
# entirely. Both are deliberately out of scope: such a host was offered
# `enable-linger` before this probe existed, so its behaviour is unchanged rather
# than newly wrong. Asking `systemctl list-unit-files 'user@*.service'` at SYSTEM
# scope needs no user bus and would subsume this list, the env var and the mask

    subsystem over: "Probing without reserving ... lets two apps be handed the same
    port -- both children then bind it and the loser dies with EADDRINUSE."

    Implemented by BORROWING :func:`pod_name_mutex` under a reserved name rather

    **What this does NOT close, stated rather than implied.** The probe releases
    the port before the pod's gateway binds it, and the gateway is a separate

    every pod boot on the plane behind up to 45 health polls of the previous one.
    What closes most of the gap instead is :func:`_walk_band_for_free` consulting
    the pins already recorded on disk, so a concurrent claim is visible before its
    gateway is listening. See that function for the residue that remains.

    Scrubs messaging-identity creds so the pod can't inherit and re-use the live
    plane's Slack / WeCom / Telegram / Teams / Feishu identity via the systemd
    --user manager env: ``SLACK_*``, ``WECOM_*`` (WECOM_BOT_ID / WECOM_SECRET),
    ``MICROSOFT_APP_*``, ``FEISHU_*`` and non-AWS ``*_TOKEN`` (covers
    ``TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN``). Teams and Feishu each need their own prefix because
    none of ``MICROSOFT_APP_ID`` / ``MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD`` /
    ``MICROSOFT_APP_TENANT_ID`` / ``FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``FEISHU_APP_SECRET`` ends
    in ``_TOKEN``, so the generic suffix rule that catches every other channel's
    bot credential passes the Azure Bot secret and the Feishu app secret straight
    through. The loader's complete credential roster is then scrubbed except for
    ``KIRO_API_KEY`` (the pod agent's model credential) and ``KIROCREW_OWNER_ID``
    (dashboard ownership, not a channel or source-provider identity). Provider CLI
    config roots are redirected beneath the pod home so ``gh``, ``glab`` and ``az``
    cannot reuse the operator's persisted login sessions through the deliberately
    inherited real ``HOME``. ``AWS_*`` is kept on purpose (pods run agent turns),
    and the generic ``_TOKEN`` scrub deliberately excludes ``AWS_`` so
    ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` survives intact. Config-level channel enables are
    additionally forced off by ``sanitized_seed_config`` (defense-in-depth).

    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` points the pod's own :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_grant` reads
    (mint, status, disconnect, mcp_discovery's remote probe -- all resolved
    through ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``) at a dedicated
    ``<home_dir>/os-home`` tree INSTEAD of the real host home. Without this a
    pod's gateway process stats and unlinks MCP OAuth grant artifacts under the
    REAL ``~/.aws/sso/cache`` -- so a Connections card in the pod reads
    "Connected" from a grant the operator minted on the real machine, and a
    grant minted inside the pod is a real, durable machine-level credential
    that OUTLIVES ``pod down``. This directory is nested INSIDE ``home_dir`` so
    ``cleanup_home``'s teardown reclaims it with everything else. It holds no
    secret by itself -- see ``_seed_pod_os_home`` for what is staged into it,
    and ``acp/client.py`` / ``acp/runtime.py`` for the matching ``HOME`` remap
    on the pod's OWN kiro-cli children, which is what makes kiro-cli's writes
    land in this same tree.

    ``skip_model_download`` boots the pod in the documented no-embedding-model
    mode by exporting ``KIROCREW_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1`` into THIS env only. It is
    a value in the returned mapping, never a write to the operator's shell,
    profile or real data home -- the whole point is that a load test can run
    embedding-free without the host losing its own model. The pod then serves
    memory and knowledge search through the keyword fallback, which is a
    supported mode rather than a broken one, so the instance stays usable.

    Deliberately the existing skip-download switch rather than a
    ``KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL`` pointed at an unreachable host. That spelling
    reaches the same end state only after the downloader has spent its full
    attempt budget on HTTPS requests to a host chosen to fail, and it carries a
    live footgun: :func:`kiro_crew.embeddings._resolve_model_url` IGNORES any
    override that is not ``https://`` and falls back to the real CDN, so one
    malformed sentinel downloads the very model the option exists to avoid.
