"""Replies posted in a Slack thread since the agent's last turn in it.

A turn that arrives in a thread reaches the agent with its own conversation
only. Replies other people posted in the thread in between -- or, for a session
born inside the thread, every reply before this one -- are otherwise invisible
unless the agent goes and reads them through the Slack MCP.
:func:`replies_since_last_turn` reads them with one ``conversations.replies``
call and hands them to ``ContextBuilder.build_message`` as
``thread_replies_text``, which wraps them in a fenced
``[SLACK THREAD REPLIES — UNTRUSTED DATA]`` block beside the thread parent's.

"Since the last turn" is the newest of two watermarks: the message this process
last ran a turn for in the thread (:func:`note_turn`, called only once a turn
whose replies read succeeded has landed), and, when that is not known (a
restart), the newest reply this app posted there. A session with no
turn in the thread at all sees every earlier reply. The set is bounded either
way: of the replies one ``conversations.replies`` page returns, the newest
:data:`MAX_REPLIES`, at most :data:`TEXT_CAP` characters each, at most
:data:`BYTE_CAP` bytes together.

Anyone who can post in the thread wrote these -- the text and the author name
alike -- so each formatted reply is redacted, one whose text or author name
matches a prompt-injection pattern is withheld whole (and audited), and
the fenced block frames the rest as data, never as instructions. This only adds
context: which messages the bot answers is decided before any of this runs.
