"""The message that started a Slack thread, for a session born inside it.

A Slack-born session opened by a reply in a thread it did not start -- the owner
answering a DM an agent sent with ``send_message(session="slack")``, a reply
under a cron post, a mention in someone else's channel thread -- begins with no
record of what the reply answers. :func:`fetch_thread_parent` reads that first
message once, and it reaches two readers:

* the model, as ``thread_parent_text`` (:func:`parent_prompt_text`), which
  ``ContextBuilder.build_message`` screens for prompt injection and wraps in its
  fenced ``[SLACK THREAD CONTEXT — UNTRUSTED DATA]`` block;
* the person, as one ``notice`` row above the reply in the session's transcript
  (:func:`record_thread_parent`), which the dashboard draws as a notice card.

A ``notice`` row is display-only (``history_projection.DISPLAY_ONLY_ROLES``). It
is not in ``context.RECALL_ROLES``, so no history replay, recall or compression
hands it to the model as a turn; ``recent_with_provenance``, memory consolidation
and auto-skill detection skip it too. The fenced block stays the model's only
copy of the parent.

The parent can be written by anyone who can post in the thread, so it is
untrusted in both places. A parent that matches a prompt-injection pattern is
withheld from the prompt by ``build_message``, and its text is withheld from the
transcript row too. The row's text also goes through the prompt block's marker
neutralizers.

"Did not start" is judged by the transcript: a session with no user or assistant
row yet. A session with prior turns fetches nothing and records nothing.
