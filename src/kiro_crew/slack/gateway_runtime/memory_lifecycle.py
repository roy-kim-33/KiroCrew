"""Memory preparation, repair, embeddings and migration around boot.

The one gateway-lifetime preparation worker behind ``MemoryStartup`` and its fence,
the paced member-store repair loop, in-process embeddings with the model download,
and the one-shot legacy markdown-to-vector migration with its re-embed sweep.

The service construction itself (``_init_services``) stays in the facade: the
memory-store seam and hot-reload audits read it there.

Composed by :mod:`kiro_crew.slack.gateway`, whose globals its functions run on;
