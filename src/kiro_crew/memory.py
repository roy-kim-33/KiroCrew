The DEFAULT store's index sits in the data-home root, beside ``memory.db``, and
not inside the markdown tree it describes: that is where the snapshot ``memory``
component, ``portability``'s export zip and the remote-sync script all name it.
A NAMED store's index lives inside that store's own directory instead. Which of
the two a store gets is ``memory_stores.memory_index_path_for``'s decision, not
this module's — see docs/system-specs/modules/memory-skills-hooks.md.
