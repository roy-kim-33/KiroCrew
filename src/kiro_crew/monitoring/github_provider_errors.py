"""The GitHub monitors' shared provider-error vocabulary.

``github_pull_request`` and ``github_workflow_run`` probe the same host with
the same ``gh`` binary and token, so they read ``gh`` stderr the same way and
honour the same process-wide ``github:api`` cooldown. Both facts live here
once, together with the predicate that tells one monitor's own cooldown skip
from a refusal the host gave; each monitor keeps only its own result type.

Parsing itself is ``taskq.adapters.github.parse_gh_stderr`` (the dependency
coordinator's adapter): this module maps the adapter's category onto the
monitors' :class:`ProviderErrorKind` and reason codes, and reads the
coordinator's shared ``retry_at`` for the scope.
