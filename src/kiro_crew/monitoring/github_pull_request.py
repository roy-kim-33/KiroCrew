        GitHub's GraphQL API answers for many pull requests in one document, so
        this BATCHES rather than looping: the subjects of one call share each
        read, and each read costs one request per chunk of at most
        ``_MAX_SUBJECTS_PER_QUERY`` subjects instead of one per subject. A tick of
        any size up to that bound is three requests, and each further chunk adds
        three. Fifty subjects were roughly one hundred and fifty ``gh``
        invocations and are now six, plus one document for each further page a
        subject's rollup or thread list advertises.

        One query carries one identity, and that is checked rather than assumed.
        The credential is this call's argument, so it cannot differ between two of
        its subjects; the host is per subject, so every chunk is checked to name
        one host and the query is refused if it names two, which is what keeps a
        document from reading one host's subjects with another host's token.

        The three reads stay separate because their failures are separate. The
        load-bearing primary read selects no check rollup, so a missing Checks
        permission cannot erase authorized lifecycle facts; each supplemental
        read carries the head revision, so a push mid-tick becomes typed
        incomplete evidence rather than another commit's checks; and a merged or
        closed primary state issues neither supplemental request.

        A subject that cannot be read degrades ALONE. GitHub answers a partial
        failure with the readable subjects populated under ``data`` and the rest
        named in ``errors[].path``, and ``gh`` exits non-zero while still writing
        that ``data`` -- so the exit code is not what decides, and one unreadable
        subject costs the other subjects nothing.

        Keyed by the subject string as passed, so a caller can always look up
        what it asked for.
