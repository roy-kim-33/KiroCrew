"""Projection registry: fold a member's events into named derived views.

A projection is a small pure fold. Each unit owns a ``key``, a
``state_version``, an ``init()`` that returns fresh empty state, an
``apply(state, event) -> state`` and a ``view(state) -> dict``.

The contract that makes change-detection cheap: ``apply`` MUST return the SAME
object (by identity) when the event does not affect the unit. The registry
compares by ``is``; an unchanged identity emits no change callback, a new
object does.
