"""Resolve the launch a stubbed MCP server name runs as, at the operator's decision.

The approval of a stubbed server is bound to the launch it runs
(:mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.launch_approval`). That launch has to be read at
the moment the operator decides -- the dashboard toggle, or seeding -- because
the rewrite that would otherwise observe it runs only at the next gateway
start, and an agent can edit ``~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json`` or an agent spec in
between.

Resolution replays the gateway start. It first rebuilds the agent config the
way boot does (``agent.rebuild_agent_config``, which merges
``~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json`` and ``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`` into the spec), then
runs the rewriter's own pass against the same inputs the gateway start hands it
(:func:`rewrite_kwargs`), into a throwaway overlay directory and with a probe
:class:`~kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.launch_approval.LaunchApprovals`. So the command,
args and env recorded here are the ones the real pass will hash, with no second
copy of either merge.
