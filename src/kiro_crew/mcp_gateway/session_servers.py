"""Session-scoped MCP server injection for the shared gateway.

kiro-cli's ACP ``session/new`` accepts an ``mcpServers`` array, and a
session-injected server takes precedence over the same-named entry in the
resolved agent spec: the spec's own copy is never launched. That makes pooling
a protocol-level operation. The broker stubs replace an agent's poolable
servers for the lifetime of one session, and nothing is written to the user's
project, to their ``~/.kiro/agents/``, or through a bind mount — so pooling
works with ``agent.sandbox`` set to ``off`` (the default) and on macOS and
Windows, neither of which can bind-mount.

Only stub entries are injected. A non-poolable server is left entirely to the
agent spec, so its ``env`` — which routinely holds tokens and API keys — never
leaves the file it was declared in. Stub entries carry ``env: {}`` by
construction (``rewriter._build_stub_entry``): the pooled backend is spawned by
gatewayd, not by kiro-cli, so no credential is transmitted here either. The one
value a stub entry's ``env`` does carry is this session's stub token
(:func:`attach_stub_session_token`), which names the SESSION the entry was
injected for and is what stops a subagent sharing its parent's process from
inheriting the parent's identity.

Project scope: the overlay is keyed by agent NAME, and kiro-cli resolves
``--agent`` against ``<project>/.kiro/agents/`` as well as the user-level
directory. A session running a PROJECT agent must therefore not be handed the
user-level overlay's stubs for that name. They were rewritten from a different
file, so the session would reach servers the project never declared -- and,
worse, a same-named server would point at the user-level command while the
project's own declaration of it stayed unlaunched, because a stub outranks the
spec entry it shadows. Such a session resolves its servers from the project spec
instead, which leaves them unpooled: that is this module's standing direction for
a stub it cannot vouch for (``_load_overlay_for_agent`` fail-softs to ``None``,
``_acp_server_entry`` returns ``None`` and leaves the spec's own server in
place). Brokering them instead is not reachable from here: ``gatewayd`` resolves
a backend command from ``KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>`` in its OWN process env,
written at daemon launch from the rewriter's ``target_env``, and a stub carries
its target only in its argv and its fallback log -- so an overlay written for a
project agent after launch has no target the daemon can resolve.

Precedence caveat: same-name override is verified against the shipped binary
(``test_mcp_gateway_session_inject.py`` pins it, including a live check when
kiro-cli is on PATH) but is NOT documented by kiro-cli. The documented
hierarchy covers only the three *file* tiers (agent config > workspace
``mcp.json`` > global ``mcp.json``). If a future release made injection purely
additive, an agent's own copy would launch alongside the stub, which is worse
than not pooling — hence the pinning test.

    A thin adapter over :func:`kiro_crew.agent._project_shadow_of`, which is this
    repository's named answer to "does the checkout declare this agent" and already
    carries the rule: ``<work_dir>/.kiro/agents/`` is the only project location the
    backends resolve ``--agent`` against, the declared ``name`` beats the filename,
    and an unreadable checkout answers "no shadow" rather than raising. Calling it
    rather than restating its body is what keeps this module's answer and
    ``acp/session_mcp.py``'s spec resolution from drifting into two different
    verdicts about which file a session is running.

    The import is deferred because ``agent`` reaches ``config.loader``, which imports
    this package's path helpers at its own module top level; the same reason
    ``rewriter`` defers its import of ``agent_discovery``.

    Only a project spec in a form the host DISPATCHES counts as a shadow.
    ``_project_shadow_of`` goes through ``agent_discovery.project_agent_files``,
    which scans ``*.json`` and ``*.md`` alike because whether a checkout's spec
    may be projected is a governance question for its consumers rather than a
    question of form. This caller is narrower: it is deciding whether the agent
    the session RUNS came from the checkout, and a form the host cannot activate
    did not. kiro-cli discovers ``*.json`` in a checkout, so a project ``foo.md``
    with no JSON twin must not suppress a user-level ``foo.json``'s stubs -- that
    would leave the servers kiro-cli does activate running outside the broker,
    with no pool, no caller-identity attribution and no governance. Answering "no
    shadow" is the safe direction: the overlay stays in effect and the session's
    servers stay brokered.

    The rule is a per-host opt-in rather than unconditional because the hosts
    disagree, and both answers are correct for the host holding them. A MIRRORED
    host's array is composed by Crew from a spec ``acp.session_mcp`` resolves
    through the same scanner, so it honours a project ``foo.md`` and that file IS
    the agent running: its shadow must suppress the user-level overlay, or the
    stub's command and credentials mount under the checkout's agent. kiro-cli
    resolves ``--agent`` from the checkout itself and discovers ``*.json`` only,
    so for it the markdown form is not dispatchable and suppressing on it would
    un-broker servers the session really has.
    ``agent_sdk.backends.overlay_project_scope`` is the one place that answer is
    computed, from the same ``has_mirror`` read both call paths already use to
    decide whether a projection happens at all.

    the rewriter refuses to wrap a ``type: registry`` entry
    (``mcp_entry_is_registry_governed``), so a stub only ever exists for a
    server the marker is absent from -- and nothing in this process can resolve
    a name against that catalog. So a stub is withheld here, which is the same
    ceiling :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp` puts on a spec-declared server.

    This is the chokepoint rather than each mirror's own projection because
    every consumer of a stub element reads it from :func:`pooled_session_servers`
    paired with :func:`injection_server_names`. Filtering in a mirror would leave
