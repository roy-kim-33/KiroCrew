    ancestor PID chain so a ``claim`` frame (claim-push) can update the caller
    of every stub connection belonging to a just-claimed warm-pool runtime.

    ``ancestor_pids`` is the stub's parent chain (nearest first) from the
    Register frame. The connection is indexed under EVERY ancestor because
    the PID the gateway names in a claim (``AcpClient._process.pid``) can sit
    several layers above the stub's immediate parent (sandbox wrapper →
    kiro-cli → kiro-cli-chat → stub); indexing a single level was found live
    to make every claim miss.

    ``caller`` starts as the register-time identity (often ``None`` for
    warm-pool stubs) and is replaced by ``recaller`` frames (stub-initiated,
    deny-by-default) or ``claim`` frames (gateway-initiated, replace-allowed).
    Single event loop — no locking needed.

    ``pid_start_ids`` maps each indexed PID to its register-time process
    start token (``platform_compat.get_process_start_id``), the PID-recycle
    guard: a later ``claim`` naming a PID whose token does not match is
    targeting a DIFFERENT process that recycled the number, and must not
    retarget this connection. ``None`` means "identity unknown" (Windows,
    unreadable /proc) and never counts as a mismatch.

    ``stub_session_token`` names WHICH of the ACP sessions the runtime hosts
    this connection serves (``claim.mint_stub_session_token``). Every PID-keyed
    source above answers per RUNTIME, and one runtime hosts many sessions, so
    the token is the only thing that tells a ``spawn_run`` subagent's stub apart
    from its parent's. Empty for a stub whose entry carried no token (a
    hand-written config, an older overlay), which keeps that connection on the

    A claim binds a token TOGETHER WITH the runtime PID it named, and this
    requires both: the token, and membership of that PID in *attested_pids*. So
    the token is what tells two sessions on ONE runtime apart, and the tree is
    what bounds who may present the token at all — which matters because the
    token rides an ``env`` pair and ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` is readable at the
    operator's own uid.

    *attested_pids* MUST be the host chain walked from the SO_PEERCRED peer pid,
    never the stub's self-reported ``ancestor_pids``. The register frame is
    peer-supplied in full, so a process that has read another session's token
    can also name that session's runtime in its own ``ancestor_pids`` — checking
    against those would let the same actor satisfy both halves and the second
    factor would authenticate nothing. The peer pid comes from the kernel, and
    the walk from it is gatewayd's own, so the chain cannot be authored by the
    registrant.

    *pid_start_ids* is this connection's register-time snapshot, and supplying it
    adds the generation term: membership alone lets a binding whose process died
    be satisfied by whatever inherits its pid NUMBER, which is what the pid factor
    exists to bound. Only a DEFINITE mismatch denies — an unknown on either side

    An empty chain therefore answers ``None`` for a bound token rather than

    claim-push still reaches the connection through ``_CONN_INDEX`` and names it
