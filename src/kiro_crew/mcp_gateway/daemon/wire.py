# --- Stub-connection liveness probe -----------------------------------------
#
# A stub whose transport dies without a clean close leaves its connection
# handler parked in ``reader.readuntil()``. The handler's ``finally`` — which
# owns ``detach_stub`` — therefore never runs, the backend's refcount never
# drops, and the idle sweep (which keys on ``refcount == 0``) can never reclaim
# it. Backends then accumulate for the lifetime of the daemon.
#
# The asymmetry that makes this possible: a half-open transport is INVISIBLE to
# a reader and only observable on a WRITE. An idle session performs no writes,
# so the death has no way to surface. ``_drain_inbox_to_stub`` already handles
# the write error correctly — it simply never gets a frame to write.
#
# So the gateway writes one itself. Each sweep sends a reserved control frame
# to every live stub; a dead transport fails that write, and the handler is
# cancelled so its existing teardown runs. Reclamation then follows the normal
# refcount path — detach -> refcount 0 -> idle eviction — rather than a
# separate garbage-collection concept layered on top of it.
#
# This mirrors the gateway<->backend direction, which has carried a heartbeat
# under a reserved id since pooling landed. The gateway<->stub direction was
# the half without one.
#
# Reserved ``type`` field, matching the existing ``ping``/``pong`` control
# frames. The stub consumes it in its gateway->stdout pump and never forwards
# it to kiro-cli. An older stub that does not know the frame passes it through,
# where it is inert: it carries no ``jsonrpc``/``id``/``method``, so an MCP
# client has nothing to dispatch on — the same graceful-degradation property
# the ``pong`` frame already relies on.
