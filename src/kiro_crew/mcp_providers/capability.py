"""Edition-capability registry provider — wraps the CPP ``CapabilityManager`` seam.

The public core carries no package-manager CLI of its own: an *edition* may
install a ``CapabilityManager`` that owns its registry grammar, output parsing,
and error translation. This
provider surfaces that seam inside MCP discovery so a companion edition's
registry shows up next to the official MCP registry with a provider badge.

On the public build the Default manager reports ``available() → False`` and
this provider is simply never registered — external installs only see the
official registry.

The manager is injected as a zero-arg factory rather than imported from the
dashboard layer so ``kiro_crew.mcp_providers`` stays importable standalone
(and tests can hand in a fake without patching module globals).

It caps MATCHES, not rows scanned. Capping the rows first made the guard bound
the search WINDOW as well: a registry larger than it was truncated before any
client-side filter ran, so the searchable set was the first 500 rows in whatever
order the manager listed them and every row past it was unreachable. Measured on
an internal registry of 5612 servers: a search for a bundle sorted past the cap
returned only substring noise from the rows inside it.

:meth:`CapabilityProvider.search` also passes the query DOWN to the manager (see
:func:`registry_accepts_query`) so an edition that can filter server-side does
not have to return its whole catalog. That hint is advisory, though — a manager
may narrow its own truncation, or ignore the query entirely — and the reach of
this provider must not depend on it. Matching before the cap is what makes the
two independent: the hint saves the manager work, the local order fixes reach."""
