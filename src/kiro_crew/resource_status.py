"""Lightweight, read-only host-resource probe.

Shared by two advisory surfaces:

* the **pressure-gated context line** injected in
  :meth:`kiro_crew.context.ContextManager.build_message` — a compact
  ``[RESOURCES]`` note the gateway adds to a turn ONLY when host memory is
  tight/critical, so the model can pick the lighter path for heavy work. It
  rides the gateway context rail (not an agent tool grant), so it survives
  agent switches, including custom agents.
* the **``resource_status`` pull tool** in ``mcp_core`` — an on-demand probe
  the model can call before a heavy step ("am I clear to run the full suite?").

The advisory surfaces carry no enforcement, no lease, no cross-session
coordination. Two sessions can both read "ample" and both launch heavy work —
the tradeoff of a cheap, zero-tuning guard. One narrow enforcement point sits
on top: :func:`admission_check` gates *background* work admission (scheduled
cron firings, new subagent spawns) while posture is CRITICAL, so the scheduler
stops piling work onto a host that is about to freeze. Direct user chat turns
and the gateway's own operation are never gated, and the gate fails open on an
unknown posture. (A hard, cross-session admission lease is a separate, heavier
design.)

The memory figure reuses :func:`kiro_crew.subagent._available_memory_gb`, the
same cgroup-clamped, container-aware probe that auto-sizes the sub-agent cap, so
the two never disagree. It is imported lazily to keep this module import-cheap
and free of any import cycle (``context`` imports this; ``subagent`` is heavy).

# servers, held live and unclaimed until a real turn arrives or the idle

# many of those may sit idle": none when the host is already in the critical
# band, one in the tight band, and the historical fixed cap of three above
# it. The bands ARE the advisory posture: the allowance is keyed by the
# bucket ``_classify`` returns for the same reading and the same
# ``_resolve_thresholds(cfg)`` result the ``[RESOURCES]`` line uses, so a
# host tuned via ``agent.resource_pressure_gb`` / ``agent.resource_critical_gb``
# gets a matching allowance, and the pre-warm population shrinks in step with
# the posture rather than on a second, disagreeing scale. ``unknown`` (an
# unreadable probe) keeps the fixed cap: a host the probe cannot measure is
