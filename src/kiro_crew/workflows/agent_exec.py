"""Production ``agent_fn`` for workflow ``ctx.agent()`` calls.

The runner takes an injected ``agent_fn(prompt, opts) -> result`` so it stays
testable with stubs and never spawns ``kiro-cli`` in tests. This module builds the
REAL one: it runs each workflow agent step through an actual model via the same
core primitive everything else uses — ``llm_helpers.stream_and_collect`` over a
provider from ``SessionManager``.

Execution model (matches the frozen contract in workflows/__init__.py):

* **default (subagent semantics):** each ``ctx.agent()`` call gets its OWN fresh,
  isolated session — keyed ``wf:{run_id}:{call_index}`` — so parallel calls don't
  share conversational state. The session is released (and reset) after the call.
* **``session=<key>`` (stateful):** the call reuses a caller-named session so a
  chain of steps shares context.

Structured output (``schema=``) is handled upstream by the runner via
``schema.run_with_schema`` — which calls this ``agent_fn`` as its text producer —
so this module only needs to return the model's text.

Kept out of the hot import path: ``SessionManager`` etc. are passed IN (the
gateway wires them at startup), so this module imports only ``llm_helpers`` types
and has no side effects on import. It is NOT in the F1 engine layering graph
(``dsl→context→runner``); it's an optional production adapter the gateway supplies
as ``agent_fn``.

    """Run the two spawn gates on one ``ctx.agent()`` step; return the cwd to launch in.

    A ``ctx.agent()`` step allocates a child agent session, so it is a spawn and it
    answers to the gates every other spawn entrypoint answers to: the
    ``capabilities.spawn`` ceiling of the PARENT surface, and the
    ``agent.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots`` allowlist for a caller-named launch
    directory. Both helpers get the arguments the subagent admission gate passes
    them (``gate.py`` declares ``agent: str = ""``/``app: str = ""``, so an unnamed
    agent is the empty string there and here); nothing new is decided here.

    ``session_key`` is the run's originating session (the parent surface the
    profile is resolved against). ``app`` is the calling app's identity, which binds
    that app's OWN profile -- precedence #1 in ``resolve_active_scope`` and the
    argument the admission gate threads; without it only the policy ceiling and the
    surface-bound profile apply, so an app-bound profile would be skipped. A run
    with no app identity passes ``""``, exactly as a non-app spawn does. ``cwd`` is
    the SCRIPT-supplied ``ctx.agent(cwd=)`` value; a run-level pin wired by the host
    is host configuration and is not re-checked. Raises ``WorkflowSpawnRefused``.

    A step that names no directory reaches NO ``await`` here, deliberately. A
    coroutine that returns without awaiting never yields to the loop, so the
    default path keeps the exact scheduling it had before this gate existed.
    Suspending unconditionally instead reorders the pooled fan-out: four gathered
    ``ctx.agent()`` calls each complete their hop before the next reaches the
    pool, so one warm worker serves all four and
    ``test_workflows_agent_pool.py::test_concurrent_calls_get_distinct_sessions``
    sees one session where it requires four.

    The governance decision therefore runs INLINE, as it does at every other
    chokepoint. It is the same call the synchronous PreToolUse host gate makes on
    every tool call, and ``ProfileStore._ensure_fresh`` documents that path as
    event-loop-reachable by design and never blocking: warm stores serve the
    pinned snapshot and a caller that cannot take the reload lock does not wait.
    Its directory fingerprint measured 57us at 5 profile files and 1.12ms at 200.
    The cwd leg IS offloaded -- a config load plus ``realpath``/``isdir``, the same
    work ``spawn_warm`` offloads -- and only when a directory was actually named.
