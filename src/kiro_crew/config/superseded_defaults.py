"""Detect stored config values that still hold a superseded dataclass default.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``config.json`` is written as a FULL materialization of the schema: every field
lands on disk, including ones the operator never set. The loader then resolves
each field as ``data.get(key, DEFAULT)``, so a stored value always beats the
dataclass default. The consequence (issue #5244) is that changing a shipped
default only reaches installs created after the change -- every pre-existing
install keeps whatever value was materialized the last time it wrote config, and
nothing tells anyone.

Why this REPORTS and never rewrites
-----------------------------------
An earlier revision corrected the stored value. That cannot be done safely for a
key that also has a documented escape hatch, and at least one does:
``test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off`` in the gateway env suite pins that an
explicitly stored ``forward_declared_env: false`` is honoured, and calls it "the
escape hatch for a server that must not share a backend". On disk that escape
hatch and a stale materialized default are the SAME BYTES, so no rewrite can tell
them apart -- correcting one necessarily overrides the other.

Distinguishing them needs per-key provenance (which keys the operator actually
set), which is a materially larger change to the config layer and its own piece
of work. Until that exists, the honest scope is to make the drift VISIBLE and
leave the change to the operator: a warning on the gateway's own log and a
``doctor`` section naming the key, the stored value, the current default, and the
release that changed it.

Scope discipline
-----------------
Nothing here writes to configuration: detection is pure, and the doctor renderer
below only reads. Reading `config.json` lives HERE rather than in the CLI so the
config package stays the one place that knows what the stored document means; the
caller's job is to decide when to show it.
