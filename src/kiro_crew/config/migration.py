"""The write-back migrations a config load can apply to ``config.json``.

Owns what a migration changes: the ids a load records as pending, the one-shot
``connections_ui`` marker name, the transform that re-applies each pending
migration to the document read inside the write lock, the once-per-process
report of stored superseded defaults, and the in-memory half of an adoption.
When and how the result is written -- the backup, the locked atomic write and
their failure handling -- stays with the loader, which passes the adoption
ledger writer this transform calls. A name this module reads is patched here,
not on the loader. This module imports neither the loader nor schema/validation.

    *data* is ``config.json`` as read **inside the write lock**, not the merged
    snapshot the calling load parsed. That is the whole point: the migration is
    expressed as a delta against the document that is actually on disk right now,
    so a config write that landed after this load's read survives instead of being
    replaced by a re-serialization of the older snapshot.

    *pending* names the migrations the load decided on, so this never widens what
    the migration writes. The load's decisions are taken against the MERGED
    base+overlay view; the overlay is user-owned and never written back, so a
    migration the merged view did not ask for must not be invented here.

    The seeded agent's kiro agent resolves the same three-way precedence the
    loader itself applies, because it has to be the MERGED effective value (that
    is what the default crew dispatched before the migration) computed against a
    CURRENT base: *overlay_kiro_agent* first, since ``config.local.json`` wins the
    deep-merge and the base can say nothing about it; then the base document's own
    ``agent.default_agent`` as read here, so a ``config set`` that landed after
    the load's read is honored rather than reverted; then *default_kiro_agent*,
    the value the load resolved, which is the only one carrying the dataclass
    default. Taking any single one of the three is wrong in a different direction.

    Every entry is re-checked against *data* before it is applied, which makes the
    function idempotent and makes a concurrent writer that already migrated a
    no-op rather than a second rewrite. Returns True when anything changed; the
    caller skips the write entirely when it returns False.

    *record_adoptions* writes the adoption ledger; the loader passes the one it
    exposes, so the ledger write is the same seam its write-back path reaches.

    has a documented escape hatch, a stored old default and a deliberate opt-out

    ``superseded_default_drift`` filters it -- which is what makes this line

    *skip* names the keys this load is ADOPTING. They are excluded because the line
