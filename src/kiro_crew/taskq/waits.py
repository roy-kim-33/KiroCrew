"""Waits with a reason: the ``WaitRecord`` and the ledger that moves rows through them.

A live run that cannot make progress -- its children are still running, a
dependency answered 429, a command wants a password, an approval is pending --
does not sit in ``running`` holding a lane slot. It enters one of the
``WAITING`` states with a :class:`WaitRecord` that says WHY, since WHEN, WHAT
wakes it, what cancelling it means, and WHO produced the evidence. Three things
are kept apart on purpose (SPEC-ADDENDUM §2):

* **identity** -- the row, its generation and its wait record, on disk;
* **the execution quota** -- the lane slot, RELEASED on entry so admission can
  hand it to another task (``slot_released``);
* **real resources** -- the process, session handle, FDs and memory the runtime
  still holds. Those stay charged to the host budget until the runtime is
  actually reclaimed (``residency_charged``); no counter is ever decremented
  for a process that still exists.

A wake never bypasses admission: :meth:`WaitLedger.wake` writes ``running``
under a NEW generation and the caller re-enters the lane queue (``resume``
entry) before it may continue -- so a dependency recovering for five hundred
waiting trees produces five hundred rows eligible for re-admission, not five
hundred simultaneous runtimes (RFC §14.3).

Nested propagation S -> A -> B: B waits; A enters ``waiting_children`` only
when it has no runnable work of its own; the wake fires on the LAST awaited
child; each level is re-admitted individually. Child failure follows the
parent's ``on_child_failure`` policy (``continue`` by default, ``fail_parent``
to fail fast); a parent cancel cascades to its children; a child cancel counts
as a failed child for the policy; a wait deadline ends the row ``failed`` with
the reason recorded. Completed siblings stay ``done``.
