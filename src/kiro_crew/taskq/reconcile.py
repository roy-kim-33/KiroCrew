"""Reconcile-first boot: settle every row a previous incarnation still owned.

A gateway that restarts finds rows in ``admitted``/``starting``/``running``/
``waiting_*``/``recovering`` whose owner is gone. Before the
dispatcher takes a single new row, each of those is examined once:

* an artifact probe says the work finished (a result file, a tombstone) -> the
  matching terminal state, so a completed run whose final ``done`` write was
  lost is not run twice;
* otherwise, by idempotency class: ``none`` and ``idempotent_key`` become
  ``recovering`` with a backoff, which the dispatcher re-claims and rebuilds a
  runtime for; ``unknown`` becomes ``unknown_side_effect``, because an external
  operation may have happened and only the entry adapter can query for it.
* a kind with no registered recovery adapter keeps its state, loses its lease,
  and gets an ``awaiting_adapter`` event -- nothing is invented for it.

``cancelled`` and the other terminal states are never touched: a cancel that
landed before the crash stays a cancel, whatever the artifacts say.
