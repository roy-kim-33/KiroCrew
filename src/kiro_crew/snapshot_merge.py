def _notification_key(record: bytes, path: Path) -> tuple[Any, ...] | None:
    """The dedupe key for one raw notification record, or ``None`` if it has none.

    Well-defined and hashable for EVERY record shape. A naive
    ``json.loads(line).get("ts") or line.strip()`` is not: a non-object record
    raises ``AttributeError`` off ``.get``, and a list or dict ``ts`` raises
    ``TypeError`` on set insert, and both escape as an aborted restore.

    A ``ts`` is used whenever it is truthy AND hashable, which is every JSON
    scalar. Restricting it to ``str`` is WORSE than keying a numeric ``ts`` on
    the number: two rows carrying the same numeric ``ts`` with different bytes
    -- one normalised, one not -- have to deduplicate, and keying them on their
    raw form instead persists a duplicate. Only an unhashable ``ts``, which
    cannot be a set member at all, falls through to the raw form.

    The ``ts`` goes into the key under a KIND TAG that is deliberately coarser
    than its Python type, because two different equalities are in play at once
    and a naive tag gets one of them wrong:

    * ``True == 1`` and ``hash(True) == hash(1)``, so an untagged key makes a row
      with ``ts: true`` and a row with ``ts: 1`` one set member and DELETES the
      second as a duplicate.
    * ``1 == 1.0`` and they hash equal too, so tagging with
      ``type(ts).__name__`` splits a row written as an integer here and a float
      there -- an ordinary serializer artefact -- into two records and PERSISTS a
      duplicate.

    An earlier revision hit each of those in turn. One tag covers both: integers
    and floats share ``"num"`` so they still deduplicate exactly as the
    predecessor's bare-value key did, while ``bool`` is its own tag. ``bool`` is
    tested first because it is a SUBCLASS of ``int``, so an ``isinstance(ts,
    int)`` check would swallow it.

    A record with no usable ``ts`` falls back to its RAW BYTES, and a record that
    does not PARSE gets no key at all. The split is the fix. The predecessor fell
    back to ``line.strip()`` for both, and stripping is what deleted bytes: it
    makes two DISTINCT byte sequences share a key. Unstripped bytes cannot --
    byte-equal records ARE the same record, so collapsing them loses nothing.
    Withholding a key from an unparseable record covers the remaining case,
    because the fragments a split record produces are exactly the unparseable
    ones.

    That is reachable, not theoretical, and it is why the two cases are separated.
    A crash mid-append leaves a truncated row in the live file -- say ``b'{"a":
    "x'``. A source record holding a bare carriage return is split at it, because
    this reader's boundaries are the universal-newline set, yielding ``b'{"a":
    "x\r'``. Those two are NOT byte-equal, but they STRIP to the same thing, so
    the predecessor skipped the fragment as a duplicate, appended only the tail,
    and left the live file with a line parsing as neither while the source's bytes
    were gone. Measured on real bytes, before and after: stripping loses them,
    raw bytes do not. The fragment is also unparseable, so it takes the ``None``
    path and is doubly protected.

    So a ``ts``-less row that parses IS deduplicated, on bytes -- which keeps the
    predecessor's idempotence for a re-run without keeping the deletion. Only an
    unparseable record is appended unconditionally.
    Duplicating a row is recoverable; deleting one is not. ``_merge_notifications``
    validates the whole source before appending anything so that a FAILED merge
    does not leave a prefix for a retry to duplicate.

    The kind tag also keeps the two families apart: ``json.loads`` can only
    produce ``dict``, ``list``, ``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool`` or ``None``,
    so ``type(ts).__name__`` is never ``"raw"`` and a byte key can never collide
    with a ``ts`` key.

    Raises :class:`UndecodableRecord` for a record that is not valid UTF-8,
    which is how the encoding property is enforced: this decode VALIDATES and
    the result is used only for the key, while what gets appended is always the
    original bytes. Validating by decoding and then writing the decoded form
    back is what makes the copy non-byte-exact in the first place.

    """Append the snapshot's notification records to the live file, byte for byte.

    This is the only merge that COPIES records rather than consuming them, so
    reading faithfully is not the whole contract -- the bytes must also be valid
    for the destination. Both handles are BINARY and framing comes from
    :func:`strict_raw_records`, because the text-mode predecessor was a locale
    decode followed by a locale encode and neither half was byte-exact:

    * Universal-newline translation on read, ``os.linesep`` on write. A record
      terminated ``\\r\\n`` was appended as ``\\n`` -- a byte silently dropped --
      and a bare ``\\r`` INSIDE a record split it in two, so both halves failed
      ``json.loads``, the ``except`` swallowed both, and the record was lost
      while the function printed success. Both fire on a pure UTF-8 host with
      fully valid UTF-8 input, so an explicit ``encoding=`` does not address
      them; ``newline=`` is a separate axis and binary mode closes both at once.
    * The locale codec decided whether an invalid-UTF-8 record aborted the
      restore or was delivered into the live file. ``for line in f`` decodes
      OUTSIDE the ``try``, so ``UnicodeDecodeError`` -- a ``ValueError`` --
      escaped the ``except (ValueError, TypeError)`` because the iterator raised
      it, not ``json.loads``. On a UTF-8 host that aborted the restore with a
      traceback; under a single-byte locale the decode succeeded, the encode put
      the same bytes back, and the live file stopped being valid UTF-8 -- after
      which its loader returns NO rows for the whole file and the next rewrite
      persists that empty view.

    The posture is ABORT, never skip, because the output feeds a durable write
    and a skipped record is a deleted one. Abort means RAISE, not warn: this
    function's callers report an outcome to somebody. ``apply_import_zip``
    appends ``notifications (merged)`` to its summary and the dashboard handler
    answers ``ok: True`` with a SEL ``outcome="ok"``, and a printed warning is
    invisible to both -- so warn-and-return would tell an API caller the import
    succeeded while records were left behind. The print stays so a CLI operator
    reads the reason before the traceback. This is why it differs from
    ``_merge_crons``, which warns and returns: a refused cron merge writes
    nothing and skips one component, while this one may already have appended a
    prefix, and the caller has to learn the write is incomplete.

    * A destination-scan failure is still a true no-op -- the destination is not
      even opened for append until that scan has completed.
    * The SOURCE is validated whole before the destination is opened for append,
      so a source-side refusal is also a no-op. Without that pass, a source whose
      Nth record is undecodable had already appended N-1 records when it aborted,
      and a retry re-appended every identity-less one of them, since a row with
      no ``ts`` cannot be deduplicated. The cost is reading the source twice.
    * A failure DURING the copy is therefore the residual case -- the source
      changed between the two passes -- and its prefix stays. Rolling it back
      would be a second unvalidated write to the live file.

    Every appended record ends with a terminator, and an unterminated final
    record already in the destination gains one before anything is appended
    after it. Without that, two records glued into one line that parses as
    neither.

def _serialise_with_notification_writes(work: Callable[[], None]) -> None:
    """Run *work* in FIFO order with the dashboard's own notification writes.

    ``_install_notifications`` writes the live ``notifications.jsonl`` while the
    gateway may be writing it too, and ``O_APPEND`` alone is not enough. It stops a
    concurrent row being OVERWRITTEN, and then orders it BEFORE the archive's rows:
    the dashboard's append goes to end-of-file immediately while the copy's writes are
    still buffered, so the live row lands first and the archive's follow it. The
    reader's cap is POSITIONAL -- ``_load_notifications`` keeps the last
    ``_MAX_PERSISTED_NOTIFICATIONS`` rows, not the newest by timestamp -- so importing
    a full 200-record history pushes the live row out of the window. Measured: a note
    delivered mid-copy landed at line 0 of 201 and the reader returned 200 rows
    without it. The loss is silent: the operator was told the notification was
    delivered, and after the next reload it is gone.

    Notification persistence runs on ONE worker in submission order
    (``_notification_io_executor``), so running the copy on that same worker is what
    makes the two ordered rather than concurrent. A queued append then runs strictly
    after the copy and lands at the end of the file, where the cap keeps it.

    The trap in deciding whether to serialise is treating the absence of an OBSERVABLE
    writer as the absence of a writer. "No pool" does not mean "no writer"; the writer is
    what makes the pool. A fresh gateway has persisted nothing, so its pool is ``None``,
    and a copy running inline on that basis races a delivery arriving at that moment: the
    delivery CREATES the executor and appends through it, concurrently, putting the live
    row back at line 0 of 201 and outside the reader's window. A broad
    ``except Exception`` on the import one line above is the same error in another form:
    it turns "I could not check" into "there is nothing to check", losing the ordering
    silently inside a live gateway.

    So this ACQUIRES rather than asks. ``_notification_io_executor()`` creates the
    worker if there is none and returns the existing one if there is. That removes the
    "is there a pool" question outright and narrows the import case to ``ImportError``.

    TWO inline cases remain, and neither reads an absence of OBSERVATION as an absence
    of a writer:

    1. Already ON the worker. Then we ARE the ordering point, and submitting would wait
       for a queue only this call can drain -- a deadlock rather than a race.
    2. The dashboard module does not import. A missing MODULE is categorically different
       from a missing pool: the sink lives in that module, so if it is not importable
       there is no writer that could exist, rather than none currently visible. That is
       the CLI restore. Narrowed to ``ImportError`` precisely so it cannot absorb
       anything else -- a module that fails to import for any OTHER reason is a real
       failure and must surface rather than quietly degrade the guarantee.

    Acquiring costs the CLI path one idle worker thread. That is a short-lived process
    and the thread exits at interpreter shutdown; a silent ordering hole is permanent, so
    the trade is not close.

    The executor is released as soon as *work* returns OR raises: ``result()``
    re-raises rather than swallowing, so the failure path needs no separate release
    and cannot leave notification writes blocked.

    Relying on that executor for ordering means its own CREATION has to be ordered too.
    An unlocked check-then-set would let two threads each observe ``None``, each build a
    pool, and never be serialised against one another -- which would void this guarantee
    rather than weaken it. ``dashboard/state.py`` takes a lock around the lazy init, so
    acquiring the executor is itself race-free.

def _install_notifications(src_path: Path, dst_path: Path) -> None:
    """Install the snapshot's notification records where the live file does not exist yet.

    The sibling of ``_merge_notifications``, and the reason it exists separately
    is that the two branches of one ``if`` had different postures: the merge
    validates every source record's encoding and ABORTS on one it cannot deliver
    intact, while this branch was ``shutil.copy2`` and validated nothing. A
    byte-exact copy is correct as a copy and that is exactly the problem -- it
    faithfully installs bytes the destination's own reader refuses.
    ``_load_notifications`` decodes the WHOLE file inside one ``try`` that
    returns ``[]``, so one invalid byte costs every row, and the next
    ``_rewrite_notifications`` -- any delete, ack or clear -- persists that empty
    view. Unlike the merge this fired on every locale, because nothing decoded on
    the way in, and it fired on a fresh install or a first restore, where the
    operator has the least reason to suspect anything.

    So the posture matches the merge: ABORT, never accept, never skip. That is not
    a new product decision, it is the decision the merge branch already carries --
    a snapshot with an undecodable record aborted the restore when a live file
    existed and was installed silently when one did not.

    It is a SEPARATE function rather than a call into the merge with an empty
    destination, and both halves of that were measured, not assumed:

    * ``_merge_notifications`` opens the destination for READ first, so a missing
      one raises ``FileNotFoundError`` out of the arm that guarantees a
      destination-scan failure is a true no-op. Teaching that arm to tell
      "missing, fine" from "unreadable, abort" reopens the fail-closed posture
      that arm exists for.
    * The merge DEDUPLICATES against what it has already written, which a copy
      must not: run four source records -- two sharing a ``ts``, two byte-identical
      without one -- through a merge into an empty destination and two land. There
      is nothing here to deduplicate against, so keying source records against
      each other converts a faithful copy into a lossy one.

    Every path here is resolved to a descriptor EXACTLY ONCE and all later work goes
    through that descriptor. That invariant closes a whole class rather than single
    instances of it: the defect is an operation resolving a name more than once where
    another process can change what the name means, and a fix that only re-checks moves
    which name is vulnerable instead of removing the second resolution. The source is
    opened once
    ``O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK|O_BINARY`` and read once, never seeked; the
    destination is created once
    ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_NOFOLLOW|O_BINARY``. The
    remaining uses of either path -- ``_safe_name`` in the messages, and the ``path``
    argument to ``strict_raw_records`` and ``_notification_key`` -- resolve nothing:
    both callees only interpolate it into an error string.

    That invariant is descriptor-bound on POSIX and CANNOT be on Windows, which has no
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``: there the flag is 0. The predecessor put a by-name reparse-point
    check in front of the open and treated it as a floor; it is not one, because a
    by-name check followed by a by-name open is a window the concurrent agent in this
    threat model chooses the timing of, and ``fstat``'s ``S_ISREG`` does not close it --
    a reparse point resolving to a regular ``.env`` passes it. So this function is not
    reached at all on such a platform: :func:`_copy_notifications` refuses the copy
    before acquiring the executor. Naming the split rather than implying it, because
    the two genuinely differ in what they can promise -- POSIX refuses a link inside
    the open syscall, and a platform without the flag does not attempt the copy.

    The caller reaches this branch on ``sn.is_file()`` and ``not dn.is_file()``, which
    are by-name and therefore advisory. They are not trusted: each is confirmed or
    refuted by the single authoritative resolution here. A destination that filled
    after the check fails ``O_EXCL``, and a source that became a link or a FIFO fails
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` or the ``S_ISREG`` check on the descriptor. What is NOT closed here
    is the ancestor chain -- both opens name a directory rather than a pinned
    descriptor -- and that is deliberate: every core-file copy in this function
    reaches its path the same way, so pinning one of ten sites would be the point
    patch review already named. It is an axis for its own change.

    ONE read of the source, and the ordering is the whole design:

    1. The source is read ONCE, whole, under a byte cap, and the file is never
       touched again. Everything after that reads the bytes in hand.
    2. Those bytes are validated in full. A refusal here happens with the
       destination never created, so there is nothing to roll back -- which matters
       because there is no safe rollback: creating the live file and unlinking it on
       refusal loses data -- ``apply_import_zip`` runs inside the live gateway, so the
       dashboard's notification sink can append to that file first and the unlink
       takes the operator's notification with it.
    3. The destination is then created
       ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_NOFOLLOW|O_BINARY`` and the validated
       bytes are written. ``O_EXCL`` decides inside one syscall, so a name that
       filled after the caller's ``is_file()`` check is refused rather than written
       through -- a dangling symlink at that name included, which ``is_file()``
       reports as absent and ``copy2`` followed, writing the archive's bytes outside
       the data home.

    Reading once is not an optimisation, it is what makes a whole class of defect
    UNREPRESENTABLE rather than detected. Reading the file twice -- validate, then
    install -- leaves a window with many different ways for the source to change
    inside it: swapped for a symlink to a credential, reopened by name, truncated so
    the second pass meets a clean EOF and reports success having installed fewer
    records than it validated. Closing one variant only exposes the next, because a
    check can only catch the case someone thought of. With the bytes held in memory
    there is no name
    left to resolve and no handle left open, so there is nothing for another process
    to swap, truncate or extend. The two loops below are two passes over the same
    immutable bytes, which is safe for exactly the reason two passes over the FILE
    were not.

    That trade needs a number, not a preference, and the number is the destination's
    own bound: see ``_NOTIFICATION_SOURCE_CAP``. Peak held is about twice the SOURCE
    size rather than twice the cap -- measured at 15.9 MiB for the 8.3 MB
    product-bounded worst case and 1.0 MiB for a realistic 207-record file, against
    the 128 MiB this same file already accepts for a SINGLE record. A source over the
    cap is refused with its size named -- never truncated, never partially imported,
    because a silently dropped tail is the defect being removed wearing a hat.

    No temporary file, deliberately: a temp file in the data home is published through
    a NAME, and a same-user process that can list that directory can swap what the name
    holds between the write and the
    publish -- which links bytes this function never validated into place as
    ``notifications.jsonl``. The mitigations for that are inode verification on both
    ends plus a non-hardlink fallback (``pinned_fs.put_back_no_clobber`` is the
    repo's audited version, and its own docstring notes the landed check narrows the
    window rather than closing it). Writing straight to an ``O_EXCL`` destination
    needs none of it: there is no intermediate name to swap.

    What this does NOT close: everything on the DESTINATION side. ``O_EXCL`` refuses a
    name that filled, ``O_APPEND`` keeps a concurrent notification from being
    overwritten, and both remain necessary -- the live file has other writers and
    reading the source once says nothing about them. Only the read window is gone.

    Records are written verbatim -- what is validated is the source's bytes, never a
    decoded form of them -- with a single repair: an unterminated final record gains
    a terminator. That is not cosmetic once the write is record-wise.
    ``_persist_notification`` appends ``json.dumps(note) + "\\n"``, so the first
    notification after the restore would otherwise glue onto an unterminated last
    line and produce one line that parses as neither row. It is the same repair the
    merge makes through ``dst_unterminated``.

    Merge copies trees without overwriting, which is right for markdown: a local file that
    is newer than the bundle's must survive. Applied to one of our own databases it means
    the incoming rows are silently dropped — the operator asked to merge their knowledge
    library and got a success message that imported none of it.

    Merging those rows for real is not a copy. `knowledge.db` carries an FTS5 index plus
    foreign keys spanning `sources`, `items`, `mentions` and `source_locations`, so a
    correct merge has to remap keys, rebuild the derived index, and first decide what makes
    two documents the same document. `_merge_memory` is a hand-built per-table merge for
    exactly that reason, and there is no equivalent here yet.

    Until there is, the honest thing is to name it. Silence is what turns a known
    limitation into apparent data loss.

    Named stores are handled separately by `_merge_named_stores`, which keeps an
