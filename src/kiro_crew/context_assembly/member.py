"""Member inclusion: the member identity section and the V2 essentials envelope.

A member's prompt is built from four layers with distinct owners -- the derived
``[MEMBER IDENTITY]``, the product protocol ``[HOW YOU WORK]``, the user's
``[PERMANENT RULES]`` and the member's own ``[CURRENT ASSIGNMENT]`` briefing -- and,
for a Memory V2 member, an essentials envelope that carries its persona, project
documents, folder steering and memory anchors. Every variable payload is scrubbed
of member-authority markers before the genuine headers are minted around it.

Which turns receive the section, and when the rules gate runs, is decided by the
``members.member_turn_context`` chokepoint at the call sites in
:mod:`kiro_crew.context`; the desk predicates (``_desk_withheld``,
``_template_selected_on_member_store``) and the dispatch-capability gate stay there
too. ``ContextBuilder._build_member_section`` and ``_build_v2_essentials`` delegate
here, and this module reaches the section only through the builder, so a patch of
either method applies everywhere.

New member layers and envelope rules belong here.

    never be silently cut, but folder steering is operator-pointed task
    guidance that the non-member path already truncates. One plausible 64 KB
    guide must not abort every turn of every member chat in the folder, so
    folder documents are admitted in order while both bounds still hold and
    the tail is dropped. The character arithmetic mirrors the renderer part for
    part (same header, same scrub, same neutralization) so the fitted envelope
    renders without ever reaching its refusal.

    A dropped tail is never silent: whenever this fit leaves documents out, or
    the collection itself hit a ceiling, ONE extra essentials document
    (``FOLDER_STEERING_OMISSION_SOURCE``) states the counts, and its own cost is
    reserved inside both bounds -- fitted documents are given back from the
    tail until the notice fits -- so the notice is the last thing to go, not
    the first, and past the count room it may take one extra slot (that ceiling
    bounds the member's OWN declared essentials, not the envelope). A member turn

    gets no folder steering at all, logged at warning.

1. You do work; you are not a Q&A bot. When the user asks a question, they
   usually want something solved. Read the intent behind the question: answer
   it AND move the work forward — take reversible actions yourself and bring
   the result back with the answer; for irreversible actions, come back with a
   concrete proposal and wait for approval. Never hand the problem back
   untouched.
2. Front desk vs workshop. This DM thread is your front desk and lives for
   years, so keep it light.
   Do focused work (a lookup, a fix, a review) right here. Move work out only
   when it is long-running or spans many items: the session tools for work
   that must outlive this turn, and a spawn_run batch only when it splits into
   two or more independent tasks. Report back in this thread with the outcome
   and evidence ("re: <the thing>").
3. When stuck, climb this ladder in order, and genuinely try each rung:
   (a) try a genuinely DIFFERENT approach — another tool, entry point, or
       strategy, not the same command again;
   (b) at an apparent wall, look for an alternative first: a path that avoids
       the wall entirely, partial progress on the unblocked part, or
       reordering so this item waits while you continue;
   (c) escalate ONLY at a true wall: a permission only the user can grant, a
       system agents cannot reach (a human must operate it), or a one-way-door
       decision that needs the user's sign-off;
   (d) after escalating, park the blocked item and keep working on other
       items — escalation is non-blocking.
4. Write escalations for a reader with ZERO context: one line of background,
   where it is stuck, the exact action you need from the user, and what
   waiting costs. Keep it short. Before sending, reread the draft as a
   stranger with no context would, and rewrite until they could act on it.
5. A quiet cycle is a successful cycle. Report real signals — results, walls,
   threshold crossings — never "nothing new"."""

    safety boundary is never formally outranked by product prose):

    1. ``[MEMBER IDENTITY]`` — derived from the crew's registered config
       (name, description, triggers). Auto-generated: works even for a
       crew whose description is empty, which is exactly the case that
       needs a floor.
    2. ``[HOW YOU WORK]`` — the product-owned working protocol
       (:data:`_MEMBER_HOW_YOU_WORK`), identical for every member.
    3. ``[PERMANENT RULES]`` — user-owned. Read from the keystone-gated
       ``member-rules/`` subtree, so the member's own file tools cannot rewrite
       it; omitted entirely when the user has not written rules.
    4. ``[CURRENT ASSIGNMENT]`` — member-owned working memory, read
       (capped) from the member's own agent-writable briefing file.

    ``desk_withheld`` is the verdict of :func:`_desk_withheld` for the turn
    being built: the section is the member's identity and rules ONLY. Layers
    2 and 4 describe how the member runs its own desk — the DM thread — so
    both are withheld, with no placeholder and no briefing read, when no
    caller named this turn as that desk (an ordinary chat that resolved to
    the crew alias, a cron, channel or delegated turn) or when the store runs
    under an explicitly selected template (the desk protocol's "hand
    substantial work to a separate session" item is what a template picked
    to do that work must not be told). Layer 1 stays, minus the sentence
    that describes the DM thread, because the memory the turn reads and
    writes is that member's; layer 3 stays because the user's bounds on a
    member follow its memory, not its surface or template.

    V1 retains its existing optional-layer failure behavior. V2 passes
    ``strict=True`` with a stable member ID, never a configured-name fallback,
    and never suppresses assembly errors. An existing but
    unreadable permanent-rules file aborts both versions. Briefing retains
    its existing bounded reader and explicit truncation notice; privacy or
    memory-scope withholding skips that working-memory layer entirely.

    Blocking file IO inside — callers reach this via ``build_message``,
    which chat paths already run off-loop.
