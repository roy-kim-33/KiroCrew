"""Store admission: which store answers each memory and lesson section of a prompt.

The store handles themselves -- the per-target caches, their lock and generation,
and the one construction site for a named store's vectors -- are owned by
:mod:`kiro_crew.context`, as is session routing (``store_of_session``,
``prepare_store_vectors``). This module decides, for one prompt build, which of
those handles a section reads and in which order: a private member's own prepared
vectors and never Global in their place, otherwise the workspace's V1 store; for
lessons the member's vectors, a populated vector store, a named store's JSONL or the
global JSONL, keyed on POPULATION rather than on what a render returned. It also
owns the per-message lessons block and the in-memory record of what a session was
already shown.

New memory or lesson sections, and the rule for which store answers them, belong
here; new store handles belong in :mod:`kiro_crew.context`.
