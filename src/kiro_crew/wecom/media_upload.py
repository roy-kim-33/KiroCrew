"""WeCom outbound media: chunked temporary-material upload.

The mirror image of :mod:`kiro_crew.wecom.media` (which DOWNLOADS and decrypts an
inbound object). Sending a file, image, voice or video over the long connection
is a three-command handshake, and this module owns exactly the protocol-shaped
work — split the bytes, base64 each chunk, compute the whole-file md5, build the
three request frames — so the WS transport in :mod:`kiro_crew.wecom.client` only
has to send a frame and hand back its response.

**The handshake.** Upload is three commands correlated by a server-issued
``upload_id``:

1. ``aibot_upload_media_init`` — declares ``type``, ``filename``, ``total_size``,
   ``total_chunks`` and the whole-file ``md5``; the reply carries the
   ``upload_id`` every later frame quotes.
2. ``aibot_upload_media_chunk`` × N — each carries the ``upload_id``, a
   zero-based ``chunk_index`` and the chunk's bytes as ``base64_data``.
3. ``aibot_upload_media_finish`` — quotes the ``upload_id``; the reply carries the
   ``media_id`` a send frame then references. The id is valid for three days.

**Chunk size is measured on the RAW bytes, not the base64.** WeCom caps a chunk
at 512 KiB and a message at 100 chunks. base64 inflates by 4/3, so a raw 512 KiB
chunk travels as ~683 KiB of text — the cap is on what is read here, before
encoding, which is why the split runs on ``data`` and the encode happens
per-chunk afterwards.

**The bytes are the payload; a path is never opened here.** Like
:mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.outbound_files` and every channel's ``send_file``, this
takes ``bytes`` that a caller already validated, so nothing between validation and
upload can substitute different content.

**No cipher.** Unlike the inbound path, an uploaded object is NOT encrypted by us:
the long connection carries it, and confidentiality is the connection's. So this
module has no AES dependency and none of :mod:`kiro_crew.wecom.media`'s
per-object-key handling.

#: CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES * MAX_CHUNKS = 50 MiB by this limit; the per-type ceilings

#: Per-type upload ceilings, from WeCom's published message-push / upload docs
#: (https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/91770):
#:
#:   * image (image type message): base64-decoded content ≤ 2 MB, JPG/PNG.
#:   * voice (voice type message): ≤ 2 MB, ≤ 60 s playback, AMR only.
#:   * file  (file  type message): ≤ 20 MB.
#:
#: The doc's webhook upload interface documents no separate ``video`` ceiling —
#: video is uploaded as ordinary temporary material — so it inherits the ``file``
#: ceiling (20 MB) rather than being clamped tighter than the platform requires.
#: A per-type ceiling refuses an image or voice note over its own (smaller) limit
#: BEFORE the handshake, rather than accepting it locally and letting the platform
#: reject it — a single 20 MB ceiling for every type would let both through.
#: 2 MB / 20 MB here mean the decimal-MB the docs quote (2_000_000 / 20_000_000),
#: not MiB — a value the platform states in "M" is safest read as the smaller
#: decimal megabyte so a 2 MiB image (over 2 MB) is not offered and refused.
