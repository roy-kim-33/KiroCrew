"""``nudge.wake`` -- does the owning session need to act on this tick?

An auto-nudge loop fires a full model turn on its owning session every interval.
``PrWatchProbe`` already turns an unchanged pull request into a free re-arm
(``irq.poll``), but it can only read TYPED facts against ITS OWN notion of
actionable: a check conclusion, a merge state. A conductor patrolling worker
transcripts, a loop watching a log, or an owner whose bar for a pull request is a
sentence of their own rather than the probe's default, all still pay a turn per
tick, because what would justify staying quiet is prose.

This point asks a cheap typed judge to read that prose and answer one question:
does the owner need to act now? Only a yes spends the turn.

Composes with the probe, never replaces it
------------------------------------------
The verdict produced here is an :class:`irq.Verdict` -- the same value the
kernel's own tick returns -- so the driver consumes one type from two producers
rather than growing a second vocabulary. The probe's observation is an INPUT to
this decision (``kind=probe`` evidence), which is why the two do not duplicate
each other: the probe types what it can, and the judge reads what it cannot.

Everything is a refusal toward SPENDING the turn
------------------------------------------------
:func:`map_answers` returns ``FALLBACK`` for a missing answer, an unusable one,
or any provider failure, and the driver fires exactly as the ungated timer would.
A wrongly-quiet tick is silence -- the loop stops waking and the work it watched
stalls with nothing on screen to say why -- while a wrongly-spent tick costs one
turn, which is what every tick costs today. So an unsure judge hands the call to
the main session (:data:`OUTCOME_MIN_P`) and never guesses quiet.

Three CHOICE questions, not noul and score
------------------------------------------
The design this implements asked for a ``noul`` (nullable boolean) and a
``score``. This build's seam speaks ``choice`` and nothing else, in three places:
``types.Question`` is an alias of ``Choice``, ``impl_jev._to_wire`` raises on any
other question class, and ``gate._answers_are_valid`` requires the answer value
to be a string drawn from the question's own options. Adding two wire types would
widen a trust boundary six merged points already share, against a response shape
no test here can speak for.

The decomposition is lossless for the mapping below. ``needs_owner`` over
``{wake, quiet}`` is exactly the ``noul``, with the probability of ``wake``
playing the nullable boolean's role: with two options the chosen one is the
argmax, so a ``wake`` answer already carries ``p >= 0.5``, and the bar is applied
literally anyway. ``urgency``'s three levels were already named values rather
than a continuum.
