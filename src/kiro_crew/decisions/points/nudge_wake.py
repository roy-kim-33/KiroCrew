"""``nudge.wake`` -- does the owning session need to act on this tick?

An auto-nudge loop fires a full model turn on its owning session every interval.
A watched subject is fetched each tick -- a pull request's state, its check board,
what people have said on it -- but a reading is not a decision, and what would
justify staying quiet is prose: a conductor patrolling worker transcripts, a loop
watching a log, an owner whose bar for a pull request is a sentence of their own.

This point asks a cheap typed judge to read that prose and answer one question:
does the owner need to act now? Only a yes spends the turn.

The fetcher reads, this point decides
-------------------------------------
The verdict produced here is an :class:`irq.Verdict` -- the same value the
kernel's own tick returns -- so the driver consumes one type from two producers
rather than growing a second vocabulary. What the fetcher hands over is EVIDENCE
(``pr_state``, ``pr_checks``, ``pr_comment``, ``pr_review``), never a wake: the
two do not duplicate each other because only one of them judges.

One deterministic mapping stays outside this point, in the auto-nudge core: a
merged or closed pull request ends the watch. That is a typed fact with an
irreversible consequence, and :func:`map_answers` never returns ``TERMINAL`` --
a judge reading third-party prose must not be able to buy permanent silence.

Everything is a refusal toward SPENDING the turn
------------------------------------------------
:func:`map_answers` returns ``FALLBACK`` for a missing answer, an unusable one,
or any provider failure, and the driver fires exactly as the ungated timer would.
A wrongly-quiet tick is silence -- the loop stops waking and the work it watched
stalls with nothing on screen to say why -- while a wrongly-spent tick costs one
turn, which is what every tick costs today. So an unsure judge hands the call to
the main session (:data:`OUTCOME_MIN_P`) and never guesses quiet.

Three CHOICE questions, not noul and score
------------------------------------------
The design this implements asked for a ``noul`` (nullable boolean) and a
``score``. This build's seam speaks ``choice`` and nothing else, in three places:
``types.Question`` is an alias of ``Choice``, ``impl_jev._to_wire`` raises on any
other question class, and ``gate._answers_are_valid`` requires the answer value
to be a string drawn from the question's own options. Adding two wire types would
widen a trust boundary six merged points already share, against a response shape
no test here can speak for.

The decomposition is lossless for the mapping below. ``needs_owner`` over
``{wake, quiet}`` is exactly the ``noul``, with the probability of ``wake``
playing the nullable boolean's role: with two options the chosen one is the
argmax, so a ``wake`` answer already carries ``p >= 0.5``, and the bar is applied
literally anyway. ``urgency``'s three levels were already named values rather
than a continuum.

    Precedence, and why it is this order:

       would, which is every failure path's destination.
    2. ``outcome`` below :data:`OUTCOME_MIN_P` -> ``WAKE``. An unsure judge hands
       the call to the main session rather than guessing quiet.
    3. ``needs_owner`` answering ``wake`` at or above :data:`NEEDS_OWNER_MIN_P`, or
       an outcome in :data:`ACTION_OUTCOMES` -> ``WAKE``.
    4. an outcome in :data:`QUIET_OUTCOMES` -> ``QUIET``.
    5. anything left is :data:`TERMINAL_OUTCOMES` -> ``WAKE``, with the verdict in
       the body so the woken session can report and decide for itself.

    **The judge never returns ``TERMINAL``.** Ending a watch is the one verdict the
    owner cannot recover by waiting, and this judge reads PROSE -- a single hostile
    or mistaken comment in a watched transcript would otherwise buy permanent
    silence. So only a TYPED probe may end a loop (a pull request actually merged or
    closed, a work ledger with every item closed), and the judge's strongest
    statement about finished work is to wake the session and say so.
    :data:`TERMINAL_MIN_P` therefore decides how the body is WORDED, not what the
    driver does: above it the verdict asserts the work is finished, below it the
    verdict says it may be. Either way the loop stays armed.

    ``urgency`` deliberately changes nothing here. It is recorded on the log row
    for calibration, because the thresholds above are meant to be tuned from
    logged answers rather than from prompt text, and a rule that consumed it
