"""Typed Jev questions and answers.

Three question types, matching the provider's three: ``Choice`` picks one of the
declared options, ``Noul`` asks a yes/no question and gets back the probability
of yes, and ``Score`` rates the state along an ordered list of levels and gets
back a probability-weighted level. The gate checks every answer's identifier and
its type's own domain before a response is consumed. Probability metadata is not
a guarantee of correctness or a selection threshold.
