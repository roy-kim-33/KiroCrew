"""Bound the bundled shell-audit hook's ``audit.log`` from the gateway side.

The default ``postToolUse`` hook in ``config/defaults.json`` records every
``execute_bash`` call by appending a stamp line, the hook-event JSON kiro-cli
hands it on stdin (the tool call -- its command and, on this event, its
result) and a blank line to ``${KIROCREW_HOME:-$HOME/.kiro/crew}/audit.log``.
The command is one shell append and bounds nothing, so on a default install
the file only grows: measured at 4.4 MB over about five weeks of ordinary
use, as a single file with no sibling generation.

The bound lives HERE rather than in the hook because the hook is the wrong
place for it in both of its possible shapes. Rotating from inside the shell
command needs a portable size check (``stat`` flags differ between the Linux
and macOS shells the hook runs under) and a roll that is racy under concurrent
appends; routing the hook through a ``kirocrew`` helper instead costs a Python
interpreter start on every shell tool call, through an entry point the hook
has to find on PATH. Either shape changes the shipped command, which the agent
spec rebuild copies into every install. A gateway-side sweep changes nothing
the hook does: the command stays byte-identical, a user who authored their own
hook is untouched, and the one thing the file needed -- a size bound -- is
applied by the process that owns the data home anyway.

:func:`rotate_shell_audit_log` is that sweep step. It reuses
:func:`kiro_crew.jsonl_util.rotate_jsonl_at`, whose contract is exactly what a
file with a foreign writer needs: one ``.1`` generation replacing any older one
(so disk use stays at about twice the cap), a non-blocking try-lock so two
rotators cannot both rotate, a rename rather than a truncate or a copy (so the
hook's ``>>`` append keeps working and no record is lost mid-write), and a
promise never to raise. The session cleanup loop
(:class:`kiro_crew.session_cleanup.SessionCleanup`) calls it on every tick,
the first within ``MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS`` of the loop starting, which is
what bounds the overshoot: the live file can exceed the cap by at most one
tick's worth of shell activity before the next sweep moves it aside, and an
install that already carries an oversized file is bounded by its first tick.
The two-generation bound is a steady-state one: that first rotation moves the
whole oversized file aside as ``.1``, whatever its size, and the next rotation
replaces it, so the bound holds from the second rotation on.

The hook runs inside kiro-cli, whichever process launched it, so the gateway is
not the only process on whose watch the file grows: standalone ``kirocrew chat``
spawns the same agent with the same hook and never starts a cleanup loop. An
install that only ever runs the standalone chat would never rotate the file, so
:func:`kiro_crew.cli_chat._chat` calls this sweep once at every chat start,
before the backend that will append is spawned; on such an install the live
file overshoots the cap by at most one chat session's shell activity. A kiro-cli
started by hand with the agent spec writes the file too; the next gateway tick
or chat start on that data home bounds it.
