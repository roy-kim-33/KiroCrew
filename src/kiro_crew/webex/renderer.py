"""Layer 2b -- Webex ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by the base
:class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Webex REST calls:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- posts a "🤔 Thinking…" placeholder message.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- edits the placeholder to "🔧 Running: {tool}…",
  throttled AND budgeted: Webex caps a message at 10 edits, so status
  updates spend at most ``_TOOL_EDIT_BUDGET`` edits and the final answer
  always has one left.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- buffered only (no typewriter streaming; see the
  edit cap); a trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer becomes a numbered text list
  (Webex renders no tappable chips).
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- no-op: the driver only dispatches this for
  INTERACTIVE + a decider; Webex runs decider-less (deny-by-default).
* ``on_compaction`` -- logged only; the dispatcher surfaces threshold
  notices as separate messages post-turn.
* ``on_done`` -- edits the placeholder into the final answer (one edit),
  falling back to a fresh message if the edit fails; overflow past the
  message-size cap goes out as follow-up messages.

Dependency direction is ``webex -> messaging`` (allowed).
