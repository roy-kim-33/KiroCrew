"""Artifacts — persistent identity, versioning, and iteration for LLM-generated UI.

Storage layout
--------------
``~/.kiro/crew/artifacts/<slug>/``
  ``meta.json``        canonical metadata
  ``current.html``     latest rendered content
  ``versions/v1.html`` older versions, never overwritten

The ``slug`` is a URL-safe, human-readable identifier derived from the artifact
name (e.g. ``"CR Queue Dashboard"`` -> ``"cr-queue-dashboard"``). Slugs are the
stable handle the agent uses to iterate on an artifact across sessions.

Each artifact tracks its full version history. ``update()`` writes a new
version under ``versions/`` *and* replaces ``current.html``; older versions are
retained until the configured cap (``MAX_VERSIONS``) is reached, at which
point the oldest are pruned.

Security
~~~~~~~~
- Slugs are validated against ``_SLUG_RE`` to block path-traversal attempts.
- All filesystem writes go through ``Path.resolve()`` + a parent-directory
  check to prevent escapes.
- The sensitive-path fence is queried before any read/write, so the store
  cannot accidentally land under ``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh``, etc. The store's own
  file helpers hand it the ``realpath`` they already computed through
  ``security.canonical_path_refusal()`` (see ``_fence_refusal``), which
  answers off the event loop without a resolver-pool submission and with the
  bounded ``security.sensitive_path_refusal()`` on the loop; the root check
  asks ``sensitive_path_refusal()`` and the source-file pointers ask the
  bounded ``is_sensitive_path()`` directly.
- Store reads are pinned to the descriptor they open
  (``pinned_fs.open_fenced_for_read`` via ``_open_pinned_for_read``): the open
  refuses a link at the final name, the inode must be a regular file with one
  link, and the fence judges the kernel's own path for that inode when it
  differs from the path already judged, so a swap between the check and the
  open cannot redirect the read.
- Tool invocations emit SEL audit events via ``sel().log_tool_invocation()``.

The MCP tools (``artifact_save`` etc.) and HTTP handlers wrap this module --
this file deliberately holds no networking, validation-layer, or rendering
logic.

The rules the store applies live in :mod:`kiro_crew.artifact_store`: ``model``
(the records and errors), ``rules`` (field grammar and kind policy), ``images``
(the raster allowlist and header sniffing), ``records`` (the persisted file
formats), ``comments`` (the comment-thread rules) and ``folders`` (the folder
tree). This module keeps the store itself -- the shared per-root lock, the
directory layout, the fenced file IO, versions and the live ``source_path``
pointer -- together with the retention caps, the clock and the default
singletons, and keeps its whole import surface by re-exporting each moved name
with one identity, so callers import from here.

MAX_VERSIONS = 50

#: Maximum size of an artifact's content blob, in bytes. Locally-authored
#: widget HTML rarely tops a few KB, but cloned/pulled remote artifacts (rich
#: HTML reports, CSVs) routinely exceed 1 MiB — at 1 MiB clone/pull would
#: silently fail on exactly the shared-HTML artifacts bidirectional sync
#: targets. 25 MiB is large enough to bring those down locally while still
#: refusing truly unbounded content. Owned by
#: ``constants.ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`` (a leaf) so
#: ``validation.ARTIFACT_CONTENT_MAX`` -- the MCP tool-arg cap -- reads the same
#: name without importing this module; re-exported here for the store's callers.
MAX_CONTENT_BYTES = ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES

#: Retention cap for auto-registered widget artifacts (see
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.widget_artifacts`). Every chat-emitted ``<mcwidget>`` becomes
#: an artifact automatically, so without a cap a chat-heavy user accumulates one
#: three-file directory per throwaway widget forever and every library listing
#: is an O(N) scan over them. Past this many, the oldest STILL-UNPINNED
#: auto-registered widgets are deleted; pinning one exempts it permanently. Sized
#: so a long working session's widgets all remain addressable for later
#: iteration while the tail is reclaimed.
MAX_AUTO_WIDGET_ARTIFACTS = 200

#: Maximum number of comments retained per artifact (FIFO, like versions/events).
#: ``add_comment`` does load->append->rewrite of the whole comments.json, so an
#: unbounded agent loop (``artifact_post_comment``) would be O(N^2) I/O and grow
#: the sidecar without limit. When the cap is exceeded the OLDEST full thread(s)
#: are dropped (a thread root + its replies together), never a reply orphaned.
MAX_COMMENTS_PER_ARTIFACT = 500

#: Max lifecycle events retained per artifact. FIFO eviction keeps meta.json
#: bounded — at ~150 bytes per event entry, this caps each meta file at
#: roughly 75KB on top of the static metadata, which is well within the
#: tolerable read cost.

        Exempt when the artifact:

        * was not auto-registered (an explicit save is never swept);

        * has been published/shared (``publication``) — a live URL points at it,
          so deleting it breaks someone else's link;
        * is a fork (``fork_metadata``) — it carries upstream provenance;
        * has been edited at all — the user or the agent iterated on it, which is
          investment even without a star;
        * carries a description or tags — only a deliberate call sets those;

        :meth:`update` only bumps ``version`` when ``snapshot=True``, so a plain
        content save (the common agent-iteration path) leaves the version at 1

        The library's "New artifact" action creates a document empty and opens it.
        When the user navigates away, one of three things should happen — keep it
        (they invested something), save the draft still sitting in the editor, or
        delete the empty shell they abandoned. This decides which, and acts, in a
        SINGLE lock acquisition.

        That atomicity is the whole point. Deciding client-side means reading the
        artifact, then acting on it, with a window in between — and a save landing
        in that window from a popout window or an agent gets overwritten or
        deleted. No amount of re-reading closes it, because the gap is between the
        read and the write, not inside the read. :meth:`prune_auto_widgets` faces
        the identical hazard and resolves it the same way: re-check and act without
        letting go of the lock.

        "Untouched" means untouched on every axis the record can report:

        * still at version 1 — a snapshot is history worth keeping even if the live
          body was emptied again afterwards;
        * still carrying the caller's untitled placeholder as its name;
        * empty content;
        * no tags, no description;
        * not filed, not starred, not published, not a fork;
        * no ``comments.json`` sidecar. Comments are written WITHOUT touching
          ``meta.json``, so they are invisible to every field above — the same
          reason :meth:`_is_sweepable_auto_widget` stats that file separately.

        The two questions are answered INDEPENDENTLY, and that matters:

        * *Should the draft be written?* Only that the stored content is still
          empty. Nothing else. A document can be renamed, tagged or filed and
          still be holding the user's first paragraph in an editor buffer that was
          never saved — refusing to write it because the name changed loses their
          typing.
        * *Should the shell be deleted?* Only when it is untouched on EVERY axis
          AND there is no draft AND the caller permits it. ``allow_delete=False``
          is how a client says "I have issued writes you may not have applied
          yet": it cannot make deletion safe, but it does not prevent the rescue.

        deleting when the artifact holds a publication record. It defaults to False to
        keep callers that never publish unchanged, but BOTH delete paths that can reach a
        published artifact now pass it.

        The flag only means anything to a caller that has already cleared the record for
        the copy it withdrew. Once that is done, a record found here can only be a
        publication that landed AFTER the withdrawal, so refusing protects a live copy
        instead of rejecting an ordinary delete. Both callers are built that way: the
        folder cascade clears per artifact in its withdrawal pass, and the single-artifact
        handler clears immediately after its withdrawal is confirmed. A caller that
        withdrew but did NOT clear would be refused on every published artifact, which is
        why the flag is off by default rather than always on.

        ``expect_created_at`` names the artifact GENERATION the caller decided to destroy,
        and raises :class:`ArtifactReplacedError` when the slug now holds a different one.
        A caller that decided over a slug alone is not naming an artifact: a freed slug is
        re-minted identically, so between a caller's decision and this call the artifact it
        meant can be gone and a same-titled newcomer can hold the name. Destroying that
        newcomer is unrecoverable and, reported as an ordinary deletion, is
        indistinguishable from the intended victim. Any caller whose decision is older
        than this call -- one that awaited anything, a bulk pass working from a snapshot --
        passes it; a caller acting on a record it just read does not need to.

        Pass :data:`EXPECT_ABSENT` for the case a generation cannot express: the caller read
        this slug as holding NOTHING. Reaching the check below then means an artifact
        appeared after that read, so it is one nobody asked to delete and this refuses
        instead. ``None`` remains "no generation to compare", which performs no check, and
        the two are deliberately separate values rather than one overloaded ``None``.

        Both checks run inside the same lock as the removal, so unlike a pre-pass neither
        can be overtaken by a publish or a recreation landing after the decision and
        before the delete -- which is the whole reason they are here rather than at the

        breadcrumb. The frontend also debounces via sessionStorage, but
        that is per-tab and cleared on reload, so the store enforces the

        the event was suppressed (meta returned unchanged, no write) and

        flag lets the handler avoid returning a stale ``art.events[-1]``

        Stdlib-only (no ``shutil``), and deliberately not a walker. Screening a name
        for a link and then acting on that name are two operations on two objects,
        and every walker in the stdlib re-resolves the name in between:
        ``os.walk``'s own descent-time re-check is ``os.path.islink``, which answers
        False for a Windows junction, and ``rglob`` descends one unconditionally. A
        junction planted at a child that screened clean was therefore still
        descended, and this function unlinked the link target's files -- outside the
        artifact store. Creating a junction needs no elevation, and the agent both
        triggers a delete and can retry it, so the window is ordinary.

        :class:`platform_compat.PinnedDirectory` is what closes it, and it closes

        holds still. A parent stays pinned while its child is being emptied, so the
        whole chain is pinned for the length of the sweep.

        the warnings name every residual rather than stopping at the first. The
        removal of *path* itself is NOT guarded -- a residual anywhere keeps it
        non-empty, so it fails, and the caller must see that: it logs a successful
        delete and fires its ``"delete"`` event unconditionally, and a Windows
