A backend's port is reserved BEFORE its child binds it, under ``_lock`` and gated on the

identity -- our spawn or a descendant of it, or for an adopted backend owner PIDs whose

    Detects the failure this guards against — an immediate exit, e.g. EADDRINUSE
    from a port collision — while NOT paying the full grace window when the child
    is healthy. Sleeping the whole ~1.6s budget on the happy path would add that
    much pure boot latency per app, which under concurrent boot is the single
    largest startup cost.

    The early exit is driven by POSITIVE evidence: once OUR OWN child owns the
    listening socket on *port*, it has completed the very bind whose failure this
    function exists to catch, so waiting longer cannot change the answer.

    Two things are deliberately NOT accepted as success:

    * **Elapsed liveness alone** — a child that crashes a few polls in (slow
      sandboxed interpreter, loaded host) would be mis-reported as started.
    * **Someone else's listener** — "the port is open" is not the same claim as
      "our child bound it". With a fixed manifest port, another app (or any
      unrelated process) can already hold it, and our child is then the one about
      to die of EADDRINUSE; treating that as survival would report a doomed pid as
      started and route two apps at one backend.

    Ownership accepts our pid OR any descendant of it, because the sandbox
    launcher execs the real server as a child. When ownership cannot be
    established at all (no port to observe, or no port->PID tool on the host), it
    degrades to polling the full budget.

    The ownership probe shells out to lsof (~150ms), so it is gated behind a cheap
    loopback connect and is not run on every poll: the deadline below stays honest
    about wall-clock rather than adding the probe's cost to each interval, which
