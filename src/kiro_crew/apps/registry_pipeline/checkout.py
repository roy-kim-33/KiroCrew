    to a commit, and this is the only path that honours that pin.

    identity and the only target allowed into sandbox argv, diagnostics, stored
    origin, and logs. The raw target reaches only the per-network-call transport

    that should be deleted after the caller's full install transaction succeeds
    is appended to it. The caller is responsible for cleaning up these paths
    on the happy path; on failure, the old checkout has already been restored

    If *restorable_stale* is provided (a mutable list), a moved-aside checkout

    different repo) is additionally appended here. Only a path in BOTH
    *pending_cleanup* and *restorable_stale* is safe to hand back as
    ``restore_from`` on a later rejection — restoring an origin-mismatched
    move-aside would give the build the exact tree an earlier gate refused.

    *index_originated* selects the credential posture (confused-deputy defense —
    see :func:`anonymous_git_env`). When ``False`` (the default: a bundled /
    owner-designated install) the clone keeps the gateway's ambient git/ssh
    identity via :func:`minimal_env`. When ``True`` (the repo URL came from an
    owner-configured *external* registry index — index-controlled content, not a
    repo the owner typed) the clone runs **credential-free** via
    :func:`anonymous_git_env` and forces the ``strict`` OS sandbox (``~/.ssh``
    hidden), so a hostile index entry pointing at a private *sibling* repo on the
    owner's own trusted forge cannot be read with the gateway's identity.

            # is never reported by any `git status` variant, so an added
            # `.git/hooks/post-checkout` is invisible, and an untracked
            # `sitecustomize.py` executes on interpreter start if the tree lands on
            # `sys.path`. Both run attacker code while the receipt records the pin.

            # `git init --template=`, which is also what keeps hooks absent.
