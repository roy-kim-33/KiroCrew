    """True when an ``owner``-tier registry FRESHLY confirms *entry*'s clone URL.

    The credential escalation an organisation-wide registry needs cannot come from
    :func:`_is_owner_designated_repo`: that compares against the index URL itself,
    and a real catalog's apps live in other repos. But it also cannot simply
    believe the row, because the row reaching this point was read from
    ``_read_external_registry_cache`` — **agent-writable** content, as
    :func:`_resolve_registry_row` says of the same file when it refuses to resolve
    an install from it. Trusting the tier on a cached row would let anything able
    to write that cache name an arbitrary repo on the operator's own forge and
    have it cloned with the gateway's git identity: the confused-deputy read the
    anonymous posture exists to prevent, merely relocated from the index to its
    cache.

    So the tier is honoured only after a FRESH fetch of that registry's index
    confirms an entry whose clone URL is **byte-identical** to this one's. That
    mirrors the official catalog, whose install coordinates likewise never come
    from a cache. Consequences, all deliberate:

    - **Install only.** Callers are the explicit per-app install action. The
      automatic browse/refresh clones keep the credential-free posture
      unconditionally, per :func:`anonymous_git_env`'s contract — they are not
      gated by any owner action, and a network round trip per listed row would be
      the wrong cost anyway.
    - **Fail closed, never fall back.** An unreachable index, a parse failure, a
      missing entry, or a URL that does not match exactly all return ``False``,
      which leaves the anonymous posture in place. The cost is availability on a
      path that already needs the network to clone.
    - **The fresh index is authority for the URL only.** It cannot promote the
      tier (that is read from operator/edition config) and it cannot widen the
      host set (``is_clone_host_trusted`` still gates the clone).
    - **Every install coordinate must match, not just the URL.** ``branch`` and
      ``subdirectory`` reach the clone from the same cached row, and
      :func:`_apply_configured_branch` forces the configured branch only onto
      **same-repo** entries — an owner-tier registry's apps are cross-repo by
      definition, so their branch declaration survives from the cache. Matching
      the URL alone would leave a poisoned row free to keep the curated URL and
      swap the ref, or point ``subdirectory`` at another app's directory in the
      same repo, and have either cloned with credentials and its setup script
      run. So the fresh row must agree on name, URL, branch AND subdirectory.

    declaring ``main``); honouring it makes install clone a ref where the
    app's subdirectory is missing. The declared value is index-controlled
    (untrusted) content, while ``reg.branch`` already passed the branch regex
    gate before the fetch, so the override also narrows what a registry index
