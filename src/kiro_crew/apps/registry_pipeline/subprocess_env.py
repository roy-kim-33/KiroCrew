    Confused-deputy defense (companion to :func:`is_clone_host_trusted`): the
    clone-host trust gate is deliberately **host-granular**, so a host the owner
    configured for one registry (e.g. their internal forge) is trusted wholesale.
    A configured registry's ``app-registry.json`` is UNTRUSTED content, so it can
    list an app whose ``repo`` points at a *sibling* private repo on that same
    trusted host. The manifest/blob-proxy paths clone such repos **automatically**
    on browse/refresh — with no per-repo owner action — so cloning them with the
    gateway's ambient git/ssh identity would be a confused-deputy read of a
    private sibling repo, surfaced back through the App Store. Such automatic
    clones therefore run **credential-free / anonymous**:

    - drop the SSH agent + ``GIT_SSH``/``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` passthrough
      (``_GIT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS``) so no ssh key/agent is ever offered;
    - disable system **and** global git config (``GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`` +
      ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.devnull``) so no HTTPS credential helper fires;
    - never prompt (``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0``, plus a batch-mode
      ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` with no identity/agent) so a private repo simply fails
      to clone (→ graceful fallback) instead of authenticating as the gateway.

    Callers must ALSO pass ``mode="strict"`` to :func:`wrap_argv` so the OS
    sandbox hides ``~/.ssh`` — env suppression and the sandbox are belt-and-
    suspenders on the same credential-free property.

    Credential posture by clone origin (all four paths gate on
    :func:`is_clone_host_trusted` first):

    - **Automatic** browse/refresh clones (manifest + blob proxy) — always
      credential-free / anonymous (this function), because no per-repo owner
      action gates them.
    - **Index-originated installs** — an app whose registry entry came from an
      owner-configured *external* index (carries ``_registry``): the ``repo``
      URL is index-controlled, so the install clone is ALSO credential-free
      (``anonymous_git_env`` + strict sandbox); the owner designated the index
      URL, not the app's repo. See :func:`_git_clone_or_pull`'s
      ``index_originated`` flag.
    - **Bundled / owner-designated installs** — the curated bundled registry (no
      ``_registry`` marker) and fetching the owner's own configured registry
      index keep full credentials via :func:`minimal_env`; those repos are
      deliberately owner-designated.
