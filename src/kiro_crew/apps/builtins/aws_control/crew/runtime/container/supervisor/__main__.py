"""Container entrypoint: order the task, supervise it, drain it on shutdown.

Run as ``python -m container.supervisor``. This is the task's init process. It
does not serve anything itself; it enforces the startup order the contract makes
a correctness requirement and then supervises the children.

The order (``docs/system-specs/modules/aws-control.md``, "Three processes, one task"):

1. Gate the environment (layout, model credential, sandbox) and install the crew
   bundle. Nothing has started.
2. The backend starts and ``wait_until_ready`` returns (port answers AND the
   boot secret exists).
3. The front process starts.

There is no restore phase and no sidecar: the backup subsystem was extracted from
this PR (durability is tracked separately). When it returns it must reinstate the
rule that made it correct -- restore to completion before the backend starts, or
the backend's periodic flush persists an empty slot table over the gap.

Shutdown drains process groups, not pids (see ``process.py``): a ``kiro-cli``
worker is a two-process tree and signalling only the launcher orphans a child
that finishes its turn. Teardown order is front, then backend: stop new turns
arriving first, then let the backend drain in-flight work and flush to disk.
Anything still alive after the backend is gone is an escaped worker it could not
reap, so the teardown sweeps orphaned process groups directly.

Track boundaries: the front ``__main__`` seam is imported by its documented path,
lazily, so this module stays importable and testable and never reimplements the
other track's work.

    one is resident in its own environment. ``build_backend_env`` closes the
    environment route, and this function asserts that below. The route it cannot close
    is the vault: the backend answers the engine's token request from it, so the
    backend's uid must be able to decrypt it, and the worker is a child of the backend
    under that same uid. Measured -- a uid-1000 process reads and decrypts that vault
    directly. An auto-approved unsandboxed worker therefore still has a route, which is
    why ``sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` stays false and why this refusal has no
    credential-shaped escape hatch.

    Closing the remaining route is not something this file can do: it needs a user
    namespace, or a worker under a different uid from the BACKEND (the gateway's own
    spawn path), or a credential not worth stealing.

    **Only ``SANDBOX_AVAILABLE`` proceeds.** Undetermined refuses, and so does any
    verdict this function does not recognise. Reading a probe that cannot reach an
    answer as permission to continue is the same defect as reading the environment
    through a denylist: it holds for the hosts someone already thought of and fails
    open on the next one. The refusal repeats the verdict verbatim so an operator
    learns what could not be determined rather than only that something could not be.
