"""Environment contract for the three container processes.

Every process in the task reads its configuration from here and nowhere else.
Parsing happens once, at import of `load()`, and the result is frozen: a process
that disagrees with another about a path or a port is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent.

`SMC_` is a historical prefix. It stands for an earlier project name and says
nothing about what this deployment is: a task belongs to the owner who launched
it, one principal reaches it, and there is no sharing surface, no second caller
and no guest. `SMC_SINGLE_PRINCIPAL` below is what the container refuses to boot
without, and it is the opposite of a sharing switch -- it is the deployment
vouching that only one principal can reach the task. Renaming the prefix would
touch the image, the task definition and every test that constructs an
environment, so the names stay and this paragraph is the correction.

Two values are deliberately NOT configurable.

`BACKEND_HOST` is fixed at 127.0.0.1. The Kiro Crew backend must never be
reachable from the network, and a setting is a thing an operator can get wrong.

The backend's authentication secret is not here either. It is generated per boot
and is read from disk on every use; see `secret.py`.
