"""Every filesystem call in the builder states what its own failure means.

The builder's contract is that a run either produces a bundle or refuses with a
reason: ``main`` catches ``ExportRefused`` and prints it. Nothing else. So a
filesystem call whose failure is not caught somewhere leaves a raw traceback
instead of a stated reason, and it leaves it from OUTSIDE the refusal-keyed
cleanup, which is where a stranded staging tree and its marker come from -- and
that marker is what authorises the next run's recursive delete.

Six findings of that shape were reported one at a time, each with a different
symptom: a silent omission, a crash, a report claiming a success that did not
happen. A reviewer samples a diff, so six found by sampling implies more that
were not sampled. Counting them is the only way to know.

This module counts them. It walks the builder's syntax tree, finds every call
that touches the filesystem, and sorts each one into:

converted
    The call sits inside the body of a ``try`` whose handlers catch ``OSError``
    (or a subclass, or ``Exception``). A decision point exists: the module gets
    to say what the failure means.

unconverted
    It does not. The failure escapes to ``main`` as a traceback.

The gate is an equality, not a threshold: the unconverted sites this module
finds must match ``UNCONVERTED`` exactly. A new unconverted call fails the test
until its author either converts it or adds it here with a verdict, and a site
that gets converted fails the test until its entry is deleted. The inventory
shrinks as the sweep proceeds and can never silently grow.

A site's key is its enclosing function and the call it makes, never a line
number, so ordinary edits above it do not disturb the gate.

Two categories are tracked separately because they answer different questions.
``REPORT_WRITES`` pins the calls that publish a record, since a record written
before the operation it records can claim a success that never happened; that
ordering is checkable on its own, whatever the failures are typed as.
``PREDICATES`` pins the three-way distinction the sweep turns on: absence,
invalidity and unreadability are three different inputs and must not collapse
into one answer.
