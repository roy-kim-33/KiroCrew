"""``python -m packaging.build`` -- curate a local crew into a deployable bundle.

WHY THIS IS A PORT, NOT A COPY
------------------------------
``PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md`` (T1) says to port ``bundle.py`` + ``bundle_source.py``
from ``share-my-crew/build/serving/smc/`` and that those files "carry
``reviewed_by`` / ``reviewed_at`` and a content-hash recheck". Read in full,
they do NOT: ``serving/smc/bundle.py`` is the container's READER (it validates a
bundle at startup) and ``serving/smc/bundle_source.py`` is the S3 FETCH that the
top-level contract explicitly DELETES. Neither enumerates a crew, neither
curates, and neither carries a review signature or a content pin.

The deny-by-default producer the contract describes is
``share-my-crew/build/export/crew_export/`` -- ``candidates.py`` (enumeration,
everything starts excluded), ``plan.py`` (the ``reviewed_by`` / ``reviewed_at``
signature and the per-item sha256 content pin), ``spec.py`` (prompt inlining and
tool/MCP normalisation) and ``bundle.py`` (the layout writer and the digest the
contract points at: ``_bundle_digest``). This module ports THAT, because a port
of the named files would ship no curation at all -- and "a port that loosens
this is worse than no port".

The port is NOT self-contained: it requires ``kiro_crew`` for its security
verdicts. ``crew_export`` imports ``kiro_crew.config.paths``,
``kiro_crew.knowledge.store``, ``kiro_crew.deploy.scan`` and
``kiro_crew.security``; when the app venv lacks PyYAML the curation plan is JSON
rather than YAML, and some credential helpers keep an import-free subset
fallback (see ``_HARD_PATTERNS`` and the report note about it). But the
security-verdict authorities are mandatory: ``kiro_crew.hooks`` (UNC-shape) and
``kiro_crew.security.is_sensitive_path`` own the sensitive-path and credential
verdict, and the build FAILS CLOSED -- it refuses rather than running -- when
either is unimportable, so it must run where ``kiro_crew`` is installed.

THE DENY-BY-DEFAULT SEAM, PRESERVED
-----------------------------------
A skill or MCP server enters the bundle ONLY when a signed review says so and its
content still matches what was reviewed. Two guards, both from
``crew_export/plan.py``:

* **The signature.** ``reviewed_by`` and ``reviewed_at`` start blank; a review
  file that selects anything while either is blank is refused. There is no flag
  to skip review -- a flag fails open when forgotten. Running with no ``--allow``
  at all is a valid outcome: an empty-but-valid bundle (persona + tools, no
  private skills, no owner MCP servers), so the failure direction is
  under-sharing.
* **The content pin.** Every reviewed entry records the sha256 of the content it
  was written from, and the build re-checks that hash for each SELECTED entry. A
  skill or server edited after approval refuses the build and is named.
  Yesterday's approval cannot be laundered across today's content.

INTERFACE (PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md T1)
------------------------------------
    python -m packaging.build --crew <name> --out <dir> [--allow <path>]...
    python -m packaging.build plan  --crew <name> --out <dir> [--allow <path>]...

``build`` (the default verb) writes the four-entry layout into ``<dir>`` and
prints, as the LAST line, ``SMC_BUNDLE_JSON=<path>`` naming a JSON file with
``crew_name``, ``bundle_dir``, ``digest``, ``skill_count``, ``mcp_servers`` and
``denied``. ``plan`` prints the same decision set and writes a fresh
deny-by-default review template, WITHOUT writing a bundle.

``--crew`` names the crew; its source is a "crew home" holding
``agents/<name>.json`` and ``skills/``. ``--source`` overrides that root (a test
points it at a fixture); by default the agent spec resolves under
``$KIRO_HOME`` / ``~/.kiro`` and skills under ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` -- the same
locations Kiro Crew uses (``kiro_crew/config/paths.py:604`` ``kiro_agents_dir`` =
``kiro_home()/agents``, ``:510`` ``kiro_home``; ``config_dir()/skills`` per
``crew_export/candidates.py``). Never defaults to a temp dir.

    The pin was taken by ``_tree_hash`` over every file in the source. The copy does
    not ship every source file. Two dispositions are distinct and only one produces a
    gap this hash must reconcile. A file ``_copy_skill`` cannot decode as UTF-8 (a file
    it cannot scan cannot be certified clean) is REFUSED outright -- the build stops, so
    it never reaches this hash. What the copy legitimately omits is different: a source
    file the selection did not pick up (a subtree with no selected ``SKILL.md`` of its
    own) is skipped, so it is in the source ``_tree_hash`` but not in staging. Hashing
    the staged directory alone therefore can never be assumed equal to the pin, and
    comparing them directly would refuse a legitimate skill that carries such an omission.

    So the rows are built from the staged bytes where a file shipped, and from the
    SOURCE bytes only for the source files the copy legitimately omitted. The security
    property is preserved where it matters: every file whose bytes reach the bundle is
    hashed from the copy that reaches it, so a mid-copy rewrite of a shipped file
    changes this value. A rewrite of an OMITTED file is not covered, and cannot matter,
    because those bytes are not in the artifact.

    A path that exists in STAGING but not in the source ships bytes no reviewer approved.
    The verification set is therefore derived from what will actually ship: after the
    source-keyed rows, every staged file with no source counterpart contributes its own
    row, so a staged-only injection changes this value and the caller's pin comparison
    refuses it. This does not break the equality the pin needs, because a legitimate copy
    is a SUBSET of the source (``_copy_skill`` only ever writes source-derived files and
    omits some) -- so a clean build produces zero staged-only rows and still equals

    Call sites all write to a path DERIVED from ``--out`` in a directory this build does not
    own -- the staging marker, the machine-readable report, and every staged bundle leaf. A
    plain ``write_bytes``/``write_text`` at any of them follows a link an adversary can
    pre-plant and truncates its target, which is the defect this closes. Writes RAW BYTES so a
    caller carrying a byte-exact signed artifact (the carried plan) gets it verbatim.

    What it does NOT do is decide ownership. The first version unlinked whatever was at the
    path, trading a symlink-follow for deleting an operator's file; the second refused any
    existing path, which broke rebuilding over the same ``--out`` -- the report from our own
    previous run legitimately sits there. Both were wrong in the same way: this function
    cannot tell whose file it is looking at, so it must not act on a guess.

    So the rule is narrow and about SHAPE. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses a symlink, ``EISDIR``
    refuses a directory, and a regular file is truncated in place -- which is what pointing
    ``--out`` at an existing bundle already means. Nothing leaves the directory the operator
    named, which is the property that was actually missing.

    *exclusive* adds ``O_EXCL`` for a caller that has separately established the path should
    not exist yet. The staging marker uses it: a stranger's file there authorises a
    recursive delete, so that path needs more than shape, and its caller checks ownership
    before anything is created.

    *exists_ok* (only meaningful with *exclusive*) turns the ONE ambiguous case -- a regular
    file already at *path* -- from a refusal into a ``False`` return, while a symlink or a
    directory there is still refused. This is for a caller whose "already created" is a normal
    outcome, not a race lost: the plan command re-run on an already-planned crew. The check is
    still the atomic ``O_EXCL`` open, not a separate ``is_file()`` before it, so two runs

    #   * A prompt INSIDE agents_dir gets per-component O_NOFOLLOW from agents_dir down.
    #     That directory is writable by the agent, so a swapped PARENT is a live attack
    #     and every component below the anchor has to be checked.
    #   * An absolute prompt OUTSIDE it gets the final-component check only, by anchoring
    #     at its own parent. Walking from `/` with O_NOFOLLOW would refuse any legitimate
    #     path whose ancestors include a symlink, which is most real installs -- so
    #     claiming that protection would cost the supported case and deliver nothing.
    #     This is the protection the code had before the parent-swap fix, unchanged.
    # Resolved ONCE into a local, and both the containment test and the reader's
    # ``within_root`` use that value. Three separate ``.resolve()`` calls stood here and each
    # one re-walks the name, so a link planted between two of them is followed by the later
    # call: the reader can be handed a containment root inside the attacker's tree, where the
    # escaping file IS contained and the check passes. Measured -- a re-resolved anchor
    # returned ``ATTACKER BYTES`` where a value resolved once returned None.
    #
    # Resolving is also what makes the comparison correct at all. ``path`` comes back from
    # ``_resolve_prompt_path`` absolute while ``agents_dir`` keeps whatever shape ``--source``
    # was typed in, so comparing them unresolved always raised ValueError under a relative
    # ``--source`` and sent an IN-TREE persona down the outside-the-crew branch, trading the

    # and then returns a PATH. Re-opening that path here made the fences advisory: the
    # agents directory is writable, so between the last check and this read the entry
    # can become a link to ~/.aws/credentials, and the bundle would carry the target's
    # bytes with every fence having passed. Same defect the sidecar's backup read had,

    # the bytes inside the artifact).
    #

    # link, so without it an agent leaves the leaf alone and swaps a PARENT instead.
    # Measured -- that read private key material into the prompt.
    # ONE authority for this read. ``hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` is where the rules
    # live: the centralized sensitive-path gate, O_NOFOLLOW followed by ``fstat`` on the
    # DESCRIPTOR so the inode validated is the inode read, ``st_nlink > 1`` refused, and the
    # opened descriptor's real path required to sit inside ``within_root`` -- read back
    # through ``/proc/self/fd`` rather than by re-walking the name, so a component swapped
    # after the fences cannot redirect it.
    #
    # A local re-implementation of the same rules was here and is gone. It answered all
    # three cases correctly when measured, which is exactly why it was worth deleting: a
    # second copy that agrees today is a second copy that drifts tomorrow, and this one
    # already differed in kind by asking ``lstat`` about a NAME where the shared reader asks
    # ``fstat`` about the open file.
    #
    # Refuses when hooks is unimportable, matching the UNC gate above at this same site and
    # for the same reason: an unanswerable question about an author-supplied path is not a
    # reason to read it anyway, and the operator has an alternative the agent-spec read does
    # not -- inline the persona as literal text, which is what the base branch requires of
    # every crew today.
    # The LINK question is asked here, before the path is handed over, because the shared
    # reader cannot answer it: ``validate_file_path`` canonicalizes first, so by the time its
    # ``O_NOFOLLOW`` open runs the name it opens is already the link's TARGET. Measured --
    # a symlinked persona read straight through it and returned the target's bytes.
    #
    # Same trap this module recorded once before in the other direction: ``resolve()``
    # collapses links, so a check placed after it inspects targets and cannot see that a link
    # was ever there. One authority per rule still holds -- the shared reader owns the
    # sensitive-path verdict, the descriptor's identity and containment; the link's existence
    # is a question only an un-canonicalized view can answer.
    # Two questions, two answers, one authority for each.
    #
    # ``safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` stays the VERDICT: it owns the sensitive-path rules, the
    # fstat on the descriptor it opened, the hard-link refusal and containment against the
    # anchor. Re-deriving any of those here would be a second implementation of a security
    # primitive, which is worse than none.
    #
    # What it cannot answer is whether the anchor STRING still names the directory this build
    # checked. It resolves that string itself, so a swap between the chain walk and the read
    # makes every containment answer true of the replacement: measured, an ``agents/`` replaced
    # by a symlink after the walk inlined the attacker's bytes. Comparing the anchor's identity
    # before and after was tried and is defeatable -- swap, let the read happen, swap back, and
    # both observations match.
    #
    # So the bytes are AUTHORISED separately, by ``safe_read_file_bytes_with_identity``, which
    # opens once with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and refuses unless the fstat identity of that very
    # descriptor is the one allowed. The identity handed to it is taken THROUGH a descriptor for
    # the anchor, so it names the file inside the directory that was checked whatever the path
    # means by then. A disagreement between the two reads is itself the answer: something
    # changed underneath, and neither set of bytes is trustworthy.

    was reported as a defect for exactly the case the third one catches -- a directory of
    the operator's own regular files that happen to use bundle names. Each site is about to
    run a RECURSIVE DELETE, so a rule missing from one of them is data loss.

    1. NAMES: nothing at the top level this build does not write.
    2. SHAPES: nothing anywhere that is not a plain file or directory. The name rule reads
       the CONTAINER while the delete is recursive, so ``skills`` being an owned name let
       ``skills/notes.txt`` through, and ``p.is_file()`` was False for an empty directory,
       a FIFO, a socket and a link to a directory -- each invisible, then deleted.

       someone else assembled. A bundle this build wrote carries a manifest whose digest
       covers every file except the manifest, and the plan is written after that digest is
       taken, so re-deriving while skipping the plan reproduces the recorded value exactly
       when nothing has been added, moved or edited.

    ``shutil.rmtree(target)`` re-resolves ``target`` from its path string, so a swap of
    ``target`` OR of a PARENT component between the ownership check and the delete lands the
    recursive delete on whatever the path names then, and that delete is irreversible.
    ``resolved_parent`` is the parent resolved once at validation; this opens it by descriptor,
    walking every component ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and HOLDING the descriptor across the whole
    operation, and reaches ``target``, the private aside, and the caller's disposal destination
    as single leaves under it. A component swapped for a link since validation fails its own
    no-follow open and REFUSES here rather than being followed; a component swapped after this
    open is defeated, because every mutation goes through the held descriptor rather than
    re-resolving the name between two mutation points. Binding the ownership check and the
    delete to one held descriptor removes both windows:

    1. Create a private directory UNDER the pinned parent with ``os.mkdir(dir_fd=...)`` and mode
       ``0o700`` -- this build is the only writer of a name no other process chose, so nothing
       can pre-plant or swap it, and it cannot be relocated by a parent-name swap because it is
       created relative to the held descriptor.
    2. ``os.rename`` ``target`` into that private directory with ``src_dir_fd``/``dst_dir_fd``
       set to the pinned parent. ``rename`` acts on the entry under that descriptor, not a
       re-resolved path: a concurrent swap either loses the race (``target`` already gone) or
       moves the swapped tree into the private directory, where nothing outside can reach it.
    3. ``verify`` the MOVED tree -- the exact entry the rename captured -- reached through
       ``parent_fd`` as ``(parent_fd, moved_rel)``, never by re-resolving a path, so a parent
       swapped after the capture cannot make it inspect a decoy while the sweep deletes the
       captured inode. If it is not one this build wrote, rename it BACK ``dir_fd``-relative (a
       swapped-in tree the operator owns is returned untouched) and refuse; only a verified tree
       is disposed of.
    4. ``settle`` acts on the moved entry ``dir_fd``-relative to the pinned parent (the caller
       renames it to its destination; a purge leaves it for the sweep below). The private
       directory is then removed through the pinned parent by ``_rmtree_pinned``, which reaches
       every deleted path through a directory descriptor and refuses a redirect -- so the
       recursive delete cannot be steered outside the pinned parent, and it is the same inode
       step 3 verified.

    Best-effort at the edges: if ``target`` is already gone (step 2 raises
    ``FileNotFoundError``) there is nothing to dispose of and the private dir is removed; a
    partially-created private dir is cleaned on any failure.

    ``resolved_parent`` defaults to ``target.parent.resolve()`` for a direct caller with no
    earlier reading to pin; the transaction passes the value it resolved at validation so the
    pin reflects that moment rather than a fresh resolve at disposal time.

    whatever is there, so a concurrent process that drops a foreign file at that path between
    the caller's checks and the install would have it clobbered -- "I chose this path" is not
    "I own what is at it now". This opens the parent once with ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY``,
    re-checks the leaf by ``lstat`` against that descriptor, and then installs by EXCLUSIVE
    HARD LINK (``os.link``, which fails ``FileExistsError``) rather than a replace: a file that

    is REFUSED. When the path already holds this build's own verified prior report, that report
    is moved aside first and restored (or preserved beside a racer's file) so no refusal path
    is ever destructive.

    Shape is not the whole of ownership. A value read back has four independent properties, and
    each can have changed since we last saw it: whether it EXISTS, whether it is the SAME OBJECT,
    whether its CONTENT is unchanged, and whether it is READABLE. The shape ``lstat`` covers the
    first two; a concurrent process that edits the report IN PLACE leaves the same object, still
    readable, with different bytes -- missing none of the first two, so a shape check alone says
    fine while a plain overwrite would destroy that edit. The build owns the report exclusively
    for the duration of one build (it only ever writes it through ``report_tmp`` + this publish,
    never in place), so the bytes at ``report_path`` must still equal what the caller read before
    the build (``report_before``), or the file must be absent. Anything else is a foreign edit,
    and the only definitely-wrong answer is to overwrite it -- a report is not mergeable, so drift
    is REFUSED. The content is read through the SAME descriptor the publish targets, so the bytes
    compared are the bytes that would be superseded.
