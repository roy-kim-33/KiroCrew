"""The upload gate: live re-authorization before each paid call, and the skip proof.

:func:`_authorize_upload` runs immediately before an archive or label PUT, a baseline
probe, or a retention delete. It re-checks that the connection still points at the
account, that the app is still enabled, and that consent still names the account.
For an unattended caller it also re-reads the per-kind grant and the scheduling
block. :func:`_authorize_recovery_read` asks the same questions before a restore's
one extra version read. :func:`_unchanged_baseline` decides whether a run may skip
its upload.

Every outbound PUT stays in the facade. This module sends no payload: its only AWS
calls are the STS identity check each gate makes and the baseline HEAD probe.

    A refusal is the outcome an auditor most wants evidence of, and it was the
    one leaving no trace. Moving the work off the request path moved the
    authorization decision off the audited path with it: the route's audit has
    already recorded ``successful`` by the time a worker thread reaches
    ``put_file``, and the Job SDK only records that the run ``failed``. To a
    reader scanning SEL events for denials, a real denial looked like nothing at
    all.

    The event shape is the one this app already uses for a refused mutation
    (``routes._audit`` -> ``sel().log_api_access``) rather than a second
    convention for the same kind of decision. It is emitted HERE, at the
    decision, and not in the Job SDK runner: ``_authorize_upload`` is also
    reached from the nightly loop in ``hooks.py``, and a runner-level catch would
    leave that path unaudited.

    ``caller`` is passed in rather than assumed, because covering the nightly path
    is exactly what makes a hardcoded interactive caller a lie: an unattended run
    refused at 03:00 must not be recorded against the dashboard owner. Each entry
    point states its own (``CALLER_OWNER`` / ``CALLER_SCHEDULED``), so attribution
    stays true on both instead of being flattened to a neutral string that is
    honest for one path and lossy for the other.

    ``outcome`` is ``denied`` for the access decisions and ``failed`` for
    teardown. Every refusal leaves a record -- one covered path among several
    would make the rest look like non-events -- but a routine restart is not an
    access decision, and filing it as ``denied`` would put it in the same bucket
    as a withdrawn consent and devalue every real denial in the log. Both values
    are from the vocabulary ``sel.py`` documents for this field.

    ``operation`` names WHICH decision was refused, because the same gate now
    guards two of them: the archive upload, and the retention sweep that follows
    a successful one. They must not share a name -- a refused sweep filed as a
    denied upload is a denial recorded against a transfer that completed. See
    :data:`SEL_OP_UPLOAD` and :data:`SEL_OP_RETENTION`.

    Best-effort, like the route's audit: a failed audit must never convert a

    """The prior run this archive matches, or ``None`` when the upload must go ahead.

    Returning the matched RECORD rather than a bool is what lets the caller record a
    skip that carries the baseline's own key, body fingerprint and version, so the
    baseline survives for tomorrow's comparison instead of being replaced by a run that
    points at nothing.

    Every branch that is not a proven match returns ``None``, which means UPLOAD. That
    direction is the only safe one: a needless upload costs one archive, while a skip
    taken on weak evidence means the operator's newest data is not off-host and nothing
    says so. Concretely, all of these upload:

    * No tree fingerprint for this run, or none recorded on the prior run -- an install
      upgraded into this feature has no baseline, and unknown is not a pass. The same
      rule the rest of the backup engine applies to an empty body fingerprint.
    * The fingerprints differ: the tree moved, which is the whole point.
    * The prior run recorded no key, so there is nothing to prove.
    * The recorded object is GONE. A record proves this install wrote the key once, not
      that anything is there now -- and retention deletes by design, so a baseline
      ageing out of the keep window is an ordinary occurrence, not an exotic one. A
      skip against a deleted archive would leave the drive holding nothing for this
      kind while every run reported success.
    * The object at the recorded key is not the VERSION this install wrote. See below.
    * Its length is not the length we uploaded either -- a second, independent reading
      of the same question, kept because it costs nothing and does not depend on the
      bucket being versioned.
    * The HEAD could not be answered at all -- a throttle, a timeout, a credential
      lapse, an owner-pin refusal. ``head_object_meta`` raises rather than folding those
      into "absent", so this catches them and treats them as unproven.

    **Identity is the VERSION, not the length.** One drive is reachable by several
    installs by design, so a co-writer can overwrite a recorded key -- and an overwrite
    that happens to match the recorded byte length would pass a length-only check. The
    skip would then hold, uploads would stop while the tree was unchanged, and the
    object a restore fetches first would be the foreign one: ``restore_download`` reads
    the key's CURRENT version, so its fingerprint check rejects that object. Since
    :func:`_recover_recorded_version` the restore then makes one more read, of the
    version this install recorded, so there IS now an automated path back to our bytes
    -- but it depends on a provable recorded version, and the very buckets that make
    this failure likely are the ones that supply none (see the unversioned and
    suspended cases below). A skip must therefore not lean on it: silent stopped
    backups whose recovery is conditional is still the outcome worth spending a
    comparison to avoid, so the current version must be the one we recorded writing.
    This is the same question :func:`_current_version_is_ours` answers for retention,
    asked here of one key.

    A consequence worth stating: on an UNVERSIONED bucket no version is recorded and
    the HEAD names none, and on a SUSPENDED one both sides report ``"null"``, which
    names a version slot rather than one version. Neither can be shown to be ours, so
    the skip never fires there. That is deliberate and matches how retention already
    reads a missing version -- absence is "do not touch" -- and the app creates its
    drive with versioning on, so the cost falls on a bucket this product did not make.

    **The probe is authorized.** The ``head-object`` is a request to a paid service on
    the operator's account, and an archive build runs for minutes, so consent can be
    withdrawn or the app disabled between the run starting and this point. The gate is
    re-taken immediately before the HEAD under its own operation name
    (:data:`SEL_OP_BASELINE_PROBE`), which leaves the pre-PUT re-check at the push
    untouched: that one still guards the bytes leaving, and this one guards the metadata
    read. Deliberately placed AFTER the local checks above, so a run that could not skip
    anyway spends no round trip discovering it.

    # ONE read of the grant, with all three fields checked against that one snapshot.
    # Grant reads are unlocked while writes take the consent lock, so asking
    # `is_granted` (which reads the grant and checks profile and region) and then
    # reading the grant AGAIN for its account compares two different snapshots: a
    # re-grant landing between them passes the profile check against the old record
    # and the account check against the new one, which turns a refusal into an allow.
    # One snapshot cannot disagree with itself.
    #
    # `_authorize_upload` asks in a two-read shape instead. That gate is working and
    # separately tested, and changing it reaches outside this path, so it keeps its
    # own shape here and is tracked on its own; the module spec records where.
