"""Share ledger — the local record of every live presigned share.

A presigned URL is self-contained: once minted, S3 honours it until it
expires and there is nothing to revoke server-side. What the Access section
can honestly show is therefore a LEDGER: what was shared, when it stops
working, and (approximately) with whom — written at mint time, pruned as
entries expire. "Forget" removes the record; it does not (cannot) kill the
link early, and the UI copy says so.

The ledger stores metadata only — never the URL itself. The URL embeds a
signature that IS the access grant; persisting it would turn the app data
dir into a credential store. It is returned once, to the human who asked.

Storage: ``<app data dir>/shares.json``, atomic-write + sidecar lock, same
pattern as the deploy pending store.
