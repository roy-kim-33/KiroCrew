"""Composition contract for the Spec Builder backend owners.

The backend is composed from a route facade (``handlers``), the private
``orchestration`` owners, the worker-session binding (``runtime``) and the stores
underneath them (``decisions``, ``repository``, ``parsers``). The route tests reach
every one of them through one facade that fans a patch out to each module holding
the patched name, so several properties only exist for the composition as a
whole. This file pins those: one object per shared name, a layered and acyclic
import graph, one facade hop for route entry points, and the global lock order
exercised end to end over HTTP.
