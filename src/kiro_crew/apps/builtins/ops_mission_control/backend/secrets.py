"""Ops Mission Control — keystone-protected token store.

Third-party ops providers (PagerDuty, Datadog) authenticate with API tokens
rather than IAM, which is the case the standard secret-handling rules exist for:
store such credentials in a managed store, never hardcode them, never put them in
plaintext environment variables, and rotate them.

For a local-first agent with no control plane of its own, that maps onto:

**AWS access uses no stored credential at all.** The CloudWatch adapter uses the
ambient credential chain (profile / role / instance role). The app never accepts,
stores, or transmits an AWS access key — "IAM roles over keys" applied directly.

**Third-party tokens live on the keystone floor.** They go in
``<crew_home>/ops_mission_control_secrets.json``, whose filename is registered in
``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``. That places it on the shared read+write
sensitive-path floor, so the AGENT'S OWN file tools and shell cannot read or write
it — the same mechanism that makes the governance ceiling un-disableable. The
dashboard PUT handler is the only writer and opens the path directly (it does not
route through the agent gate), so the operator's Settings UI still works.

Why not ``config.json``? Because Kiro Crew serves an app's ``data/config.json``
over ``/api/apps/<name>/config`` **without session auth** — a documented behavior
apps rely on to bootstrap their UI. A token in there would be readable by anything
that can reach the gateway port. And a token in the main ``config.json`` would be
writable by any auto-approved agent shell. Neither is acceptable for a credential
that can resolve a stranger's production pages.

**Optional rotation.** ``SecretBackend`` is a seam. The default is the local
keystone file; an AWS Secrets Manager backend lets users already on AWS get the
recommended ≤90-day rotation instead of a recommendation they cannot act on.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (secret storage).

    # adapter four credential shapes: AKIA, PagerDuty and Datadog keys were redacted and
    # `Bearer sk-...` reached the investigation brief, i.e. the model's prompt, in clear
    # text.

    # Core's own bearer pattern requires the literal `Authorization` (deliberately — so a
    # bare `Bearer` cannot over-capture), so it did not catch this SHAPE either. But core is
    # not the weak link: it matches real vendor keys by their OWN patterns regardless of any
    # `Bearer` prefix — verified for OpenAI `sk-proj-`, Anthropic `sk-ant-`, Slack `xoxb-`,
    # Stripe `sk_live_`, GitHub `ghp_`, JWTs and AKIA. What slips through core is only an
    # opaque token with no recognizable prefix, which is exactly the residual case this
    # app-level carrier pattern exists to cover.
    #
    # `\s+` OR `\s*[:=]\s*` rather than making the separator a bare `\s*`: without the
