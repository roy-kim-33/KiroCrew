"""incident.io adapter — signals, rotation, and actions.

One class implements three Protocols because incident.io answers all three questions
with the same credential: what is firing (alerts), who is on shift (schedules), and
how to respond (resolve an alert / attach a note).

The adapter is built on **alerts**, not incidents, and that choice runs through every
method. An incident.io alert carries a two-value status — ``firing`` or ``resolved`` —
which is the same shape as a signal's own lifecycle, so absence from a poll means the
alert cleared. A declared incident is a human artefact with an eight-category status
whose transitions run a post-incident flow; treating one as a firing signal would put
work on the board that is already owned by a responder.

The API key can resolve real alerts, so it lives in the keystone-protected secret store
(``secrets.py``), never in the app config, and is never returned by a read endpoint.
