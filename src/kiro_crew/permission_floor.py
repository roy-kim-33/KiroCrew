"""The security floor every ACP permission approval passes through.

Each consumer of a permission request (dashboard, Slack, channels, cron,
subagents, ...) is expected to consult ``HookManager.on_tool_call`` and refuse
a ``TOOL_DENY`` before it approves. That is a per-consumer duty, and a consumer
that forgets it approves a call the deny floor refuses everywhere else.

The two transports that can send an ``allow`` answer -- ``AcpClient`` and
``SessionHandle`` -- call :func:`refusal_for` inside ``approve_tool``, so the
always-on security tiers (the denied-command floor, the sensitive-path read and
write checks, the unverifiable-shell refusal) hold for every consumer, whether
or not it wired the gate.

Only a SECURITY deny refuses at the transport. The governance ceiling is a
POLICY deny that depends on the calling surface's identity (session, agent,
app), which a transport does not know, so asking it here with an empty identity
could refuse a call the consumer's own identity-aware check allowed. Governance
stays the consumer's job; the transport floor is the part that needs no
identity. A consumer that has an identity (the Agent-Channels loop) calls the
same :func:`refusal_for` with it and ``security_only=False``, so there is one
gate-consultation body for both.

    the keystone file apply here the same as on every consumer.

    With ``security_only=True`` (the transports) only a SECURITY deny refuses,

    gate decision.

    Synchronous: it reads config, the keystone file and governance state, so
    callers run it off the event loop. Fails CLOSED: a gate that cannot be built
