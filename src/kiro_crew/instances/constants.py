"""Tunable constants for the Instances feature.

Isolated in this module so resource limits and defaults can be adjusted in one
place without hunting through the registry / tunnel-manager code.

These values are the *defaults* for the corresponding ``InstancesConfig`` fields
in ``kiro_crew.config.loader``; a user can override them via
``kirocrew config set instances.<key> <value>``. Keeping the canonical default
here (and referencing it from the dataclass) means the constant and the config
default can never drift apart.

# Maximum number of remote instances kept "warm" (iframe mounted + tunnel +
# WebSocket live) at once. Each warm instance is a full dashboard SPA, so this
# bounds memory/socket usage; least-recently-used instances beyond the cap are
# lazily evicted and reconnected on demand.
#
# ``WARM_SET_CAP_AUTO`` (0) is the default and means "as many as are registered,
# up to ``WARM_SET_CAP_AUTO_CEILING``": the cap is resolved per request from the
# number of crews in the registry (see
# ``kiro_crew.instances.warm_set.resolve_warm_set_cap``), so below that ceiling no
# crew the operator configured is evicted, and adding one widens the cap by
# itself. Past the ceiling eviction resumes -- see its own comment below.
#
# Auto is the default because eviction is INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A DISCONNECT at
# the pane: the iframe is unmounted, the token is re-minted and the remote SPA
# cold-boots on the next click (surfacing the error panel outright if readiness
# misses its timeout). A cap below the number of crews in use therefore turns
# ordinary tab switching into an apparent connection flap, and the operator has
# no way to attribute it -- the tunnel is up the whole time. Tracking the registry
# removes that class of misconfiguration rather than asking anyone to keep two
# numbers in sync by hand.
#
# REGISTERED, not connected. Counting connected (a live count) races
# tunnel startup: a crew that finishes connecting a moment after the dashboard
# polls falls outside the cap and has its pane evicted. Exactly one crew looks
# broken, and which one depends on connection order -- so it moves on every
# restart and reads as a random failure rather than as a cap.

# Beyond this many registered crews eviction resumes, so the worst case stays
# bounded while the common small-fleet case (the reason auto exists) never
# evicts. An EXPLICIT integer cap is honoured verbatim and is deliberately not
# clamped by this: an operator who names a number has made the budget decision
# themselves, including a number larger than this.
#
# 10 is a product target, not a measurement: it is the fleet size the Remote
# Crew surface is designed around, raised from 8 without removing the resource
# bound. Ten warm panes has not been measured on a single renderer; the number
# an install can actually carry is still the operator's call via an explicit
# cap. The per-pane cost that bounds
# it is CPU and worker threads rather than heap -- each pane is a full SPA with
# its own polling and WebSocket, and a pane the user opens a diff in spawns its
# own highlighter worker pool (see website/src/main.tsx on why those are no
# longer spawned eagerly).

# worst case of MINT_TIMEOUT_CEILING_SECS + 15 for a chained mint and
# DEFAULT_SSM_MINT_TIMEOUT_SECS for an SSM one -- so the slowest mint in the tree

#
# 64 live leases through one gateway. A lease exists only while a chained credential

# `kirocrew restart` that invalidates tokens); an iframe loaded with a stale
# token gets a server-rendered 403 page, so the SPA never boots to fire the
# reactive `mc-auth-expired` recovery. The probe (GET /api/status?token=... over
# the existing tunnel — no SSH) closes that initial-load gap. It is
# deny-by-default: anything but a positive 2xx (including a timeout/connection
# error) is treated as invalid and forces a fresh mint; if that mint also fails

# kept as short as that work allows because a capability read blocks a chat
# header from rendering: a user watching an empty picker is better served by a
# fast "peer did not answer" than by a long wait. It sits above the

# Timeout (secs) for the peer's /api/models capability read specifically. The

# Budgeting it at the shared 8s guarantees the cold read is killed by this side
# while the peer's own bounded work is still running, and the aggregator then
# reports `capability_unreachable` for a peer that is healthy — the model

# That ordering is the point: the parent's own timeout fires first, so a slow crew

# hostile or broken peer.
#
# Its OWN constant rather than borrowing CAPABILITY_REPLY_MAX_BYTES, and 4 MiB

# reply is fixed-shape: one agent roster, one model list, sized by how the peer is
# configured and not by how much it is being used. This reply and the federated
# search one are UNBOUNDED-CARDINALITY lists — N open sessions, N search hits —
# whose honest size scales with a peer's workload, so they carry the looser bound
# and the search cap's 4 MiB is the precedent this follows.
#
# Sharing one constant across endpoints that differ that way is the actual hazard:
# each of these comments records the specific honest payload its number was sized
# against, and one symbol cannot hold three such rationales. A later change
