"""Run-marker so remote token-mint targets the *running* gateway's install.

The problem this solves:
    Token mint SSHes to the remote desktop and runs ``kirocrew token`` resolved
    from a fixed PATH candidate list (:data:`token_mint.REMOTE_BIN_CANDIDATES`,
    first entry ``$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew``). When that launcher symlinks into
    an *uninstalled* git worktree (no ``.venv``), every mint fails with
    "KiroCrew venv not found" — even though the gateway itself is up and healthy,
    because it runs from a *different* venv. The user's sync -> rebuild -> restart
    of the gateway can't fix mint, since mint never consults the gateway's own
    install. The proactive/reactive token-refresh loop then re-mints on every
    poll and fails, which surfaces as the pane periodically disconnecting and
    reconnecting.

The fix:
    At startup the gateway records the absolute path to *its own* ``kirocrew``
    launcher, keyed by the port it serves, at
    ``<config_dir>/run/gateway-<port>.bin``. The mint shell snippet reads that
    marker first and, when it names an executable, ``exec``s it — guaranteeing
    mint uses the same built venv as the live gateway. An absent/stale marker
    (older remotes, or a gateway that isn't running) makes mint fall back to the
    candidate search, so nothing regresses.

Trust: the marker lives in the ``0700`` ``run/`` dir (owner-only) and is written
``0600`` by the gateway itself; the dir is on the ``is_sensitive_path`` floor
(``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) so agent file tools cannot write it. That
write boundary — not an ownership check on the mint side — is what bounds who can
plant a marker; the mint side additionally only ``exec``s the path when it is an
executable file (``-x``), the same boundary as the pre-existing
``~/.local/bin/kirocrew`` candidate.

Second consumer — port discovery:
    The marker's *filename* also advertises which port a gateway is serving, so
    :func:`marker_ports` lets a local client command (``token`` / ``status`` /
    ``logout`` / ``stop``, via ``port_resolution.resolve_client_port``) find a gateway
    on a non-default port with zero configuration. That path reads only the
    filename, never the recorded launcher path.

    A marker is NOT proof a gateway is there: :func:`clear_marker` runs only on
    graceful shutdown, so a crash or SIGKILL leaves the file behind and an
    unrelated process may since have bound that port. Because client commands
    send the local secret (``X-Local-Secret``) to whatever is listening, the
    consumer MUST verify the listener before trusting a discovered port, using
    the pid sidecar this module writes beside the marker (:func:`read_pid`) — see
    ``port_resolution._gateway_owns_port``. This module deliberately does not offer a
    bare "is something listening" helper, so no caller can mistake reachability
    for identity.

    - :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.process_start_time` is the fallback, and

      ``FILETIME`` (100-ns units) through a query-only handle, while

      ``None`` everywhere else. Without this leg the token is empty on every
      Windows host, so a pod there could never prove ownership at all — an
      unsatisfiable requirement rather than a strict one.

    The fallback's value is whitespace-collapsed because the macOS ``ps``
    spelling is space-padded and the reader requires a single token; Windows
    returns a bare integer, so the collapse is a no-op there.

    what makes the name safe to dial: if the gateway holds v4 AND v6 on this
    port, then whichever family the resolver picks, the party reached is the

    is current, and it is the only writer.

    What it must NOT reap is a sibling that is still serving. ``gateway.lock``
    makes a gateway a singleton per data home only when every start goes through
    it; in practice one machine runs several -- a second gateway launched by hand,
    one started from another checkout that inherits the default data home, a
    cutover overlapping its predecessor -- and those really do share a home. A
    blanket prune then deletes a LIVE gateway's marker and pid sidecar, which
    makes it undiscoverable to `token` / `status` / `stop` and removes the very
    evidence the credential writer uses to avoid clobbering that gateway's
    credential. So each candidate is checked against the same ownership proof its
    readers use (recorded pid, holds the port, same uid, argv looks like a
    gateway) and skipped when it passes.

    Best-effort and never raises: a marker we fail to remove only costs a future

    It removes the marker, the pid sidecar and that pid's start identity, but

    The exact inverse of :func:`note_published_listener`, and the reason it

    questions. ``clear_marker`` says "this generation is going away", so it takes
    every address at once along with the marker, the pid and the port-keyed
    credential. This says "this generation has let go of THIS address" while it
    keeps serving the others -- a state a whole-generation teardown cannot
    express, and calling ``clear_marker`` to reach one sidecar would delete the
    live listener's own credential and the marker a supervisor reads.

    Both halves matter and the in-memory half is the one easy to omit. Unlinking
    the file alone leaves ``_PUBLISHED_LISTENERS`` asserting coverage this
    process lacks, and that set is what a later ``clear_marker`` deletes from --
    so the stale entry would survive as a claim about an address someone else may
    by then hold. Dropping both keeps the invariant every consumer reads: a
    listener sidecar on disk means its generation holds that address NOW.

    Scoped by the same ownership rule ``clear_marker`` follows: an address this
    process never published is not deleted, because the file under that name then
    belongs to somebody else -- two gateways in one data home can hold the same
    port on different addresses, and unlinking a sibling's entry costs it every
    client that had already read it. Returns whether the credential is retracted,
    so a caller can log the real outcome rather than its intent.

    FAIL CLOSED when the filesystem refuses, in both directions, because what a
    failed unlink leaves behind is a readable credential for an address this
    generation does not hold -- and a client's coverage test is an INTERSECTION
    over the secret, so that one surviving file re-admits the live family's own
    secret and the mint sends it to whoever took the address (see
    ``listenerSecretsFor`` in ``website/electron/local-token.js``). A sharing
    violation or an unavailable share is ordinary on Windows, which is the only
    platform the listener guards arm on, so this path is reached by accident
    rather than by extremity:

    * **Truncate what cannot be unlinked.** An empty sidecar covers no family --
      the reader skips a blank secret -- so emptying the file removes the address
      from the intersection and the mint refuses instead of misdirecting the
      secret. That is the same degradation the rest of this feature accepts: one
      explicit sign-in.
    * **Keep the claim when neither works.** A credential still on disk is one a
      later ``clear_marker`` must delete, and ``clear_marker`` deletes only what

    The start identity goes with the pid it attests: on its own it names nothing,
    and leaving it beside a pid file a later gateway rewrites is exactly the
    stale-token pairing the freshness check exists to refuse.

    The credentials go too -- the port-keyed one, and the listener-keyed entries
    THIS PROCESS published (:func:`note_published_listener`). Each names a
    generation that does not own the port, so leaving one behind would let a
    client authenticate with a value the next owner never had.

    Scoped to this process's own entries rather than every entry naming the port,
    because a port and a listener are not the same thing: two gateways in one data
    home can hold the same port on different addresses, and enumerating by port
    would delete the OTHER one's credential while it is still serving -- answering
    403 to every client that had already read it. What cannot be proven is not
    deleted.

    An entry this process did not publish is therefore left in place, and that is
    safe rather than merely conservative: a client reading a stale entry is
    refused by the gateway and moves on to the next candidate for that family
    (see the walk in ``listenerSecretsFor``), so the cost is one wasted round trip
    -- while deleting a live sibling's entry costs that sibling every client it
    had. A crash leaves everything (nothing runs), which is why every consumer

    Answers True when files were removed, False when the pid record names another
    process and nothing was touched.

    What separates this from :func:`clear_marker` is WHEN each one runs.
    ``clear_marker`` runs while the shutting-down gateway still holds its
    listener, so no other process can have published under these names yet, and
    clearing by location is therefore clearing its own. This runs from a detached
    thread at an arbitrary later point, which may be after the listener is free
    and a replacement gateway has bound the port and published its own state. At
    that point a location does not identify an owner, so the action is scoped
    twice, and the two scopes cover different things:

    * Never a credential, whatever the pid record says. This is the
      unconditional half, and it is the one that matters: the late write this
      exists to undo creates no credential, so deleting one reaches past the
      mistake being corrected, and deleting a successor's would answer 403 to
      every client that had already read it.
    * Only while the pid record names THIS process, which declines the marker,
      pid and start identity of a gateway that is not this one. Its reach is
      narrower than it looks, and the limit is worth stating: a late
      :func:`write_marker` rewrites that record with this process's own pid, so
      after a write that landed the answer is True by construction. What the
      check covers is every path where the write did NOT land -- it is
      best-effort and swallows its own failures -- plus any caller that reaches
      here without writing first. It cannot undo a clobber that already
      happened, and a pid read taken BEFORE the write cannot substitute for it:
      the successor appears after that read, so the value it returns is this
      port's previous occupant, not its next one. Keeping a successor's marker
      intact means guarding the WRITE, which is a change on the gateway boot
      path rather than here.

    An unreadable pid record answers False for the same reason: an owner that
    cannot be established is treated as somebody else's.
