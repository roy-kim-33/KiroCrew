"""Instances registry — persistent store of remote KiroCrew instances.

Backs the *Instances* feature (multi-instance management). The registry is a
small JSON file at ``~/.kiro/crew/instances.json``. Each record describes how to
reach one remote Kiro Crew over **either SSH or AWS SSM Session Manager**
(``connection_method``); the *local* instance is implicit (the gateway itself)
and is never stored here.

Two persisted hints support lazy reconnect on gateway restart:

* per-instance ``was_connected`` — whether the instance had an open tunnel when
  it was last touched; renders "disconnected — click to reconnect".
* top-level ``last_active_id`` — the single instance to auto-revive on startup
  (startup opens *no* other tunnels, avoiding a stale-credential ssh herd).

Security notes (standard practices):

* No credentials/tokens are ever written here. Records hold only connection
  *coordinates* (ssh host alias, ports, ttl). Dashboard tokens are minted at
  connect time and live only in memory / the browser cookie.
* ``ssh_host`` and ``remote_bin`` get a light charset check here to reject
  obviously malformed input early; the injection-safe validation that guards
  the actual ``ssh`` command line lives with the ``SshTunnelManager``.
* Writes go through :func:`kiro_crew.atomic_write.atomic_write` (temp file +
  rename) so a crash mid-write can't corrupt the registry.

The registry reads-then-writes the file on every mutation rather than caching an
in-memory copy, and holds a lock keyed by the registry's path across that pair,
so two registry objects in one gateway don't clobber each other's changes. An
out-of-band ``kirocrew`` CLI edit is a separate process and so is outside that
lock: it always reads a complete file, but a mutation it interleaves with the
gateway's can still be lost.
