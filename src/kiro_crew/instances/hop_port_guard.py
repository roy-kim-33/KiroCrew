"""OS-level ownership of a lent hop port, for as long as its lease stands.

A hop lease withholds a port from THIS gateway's allocator. That is not ownership:
once the forward that served the lent crew is torn down, the port is free at the OS
level, and any other local process -- including a second gateway with its own
registry, which cannot see this lease at all -- may bind it. The holder of the
chained credential goes on dialling that port, so whatever bound it receives a live
bearer token. The hub-side identity check only runs on a subsequent mint, and the
proactive re-mint is scheduled at ~80% of the token's lifetime, so on the default 20h
TTL the exposure would last hours rather than being caught promptly.

This closes it by making the parent keep the port itself while the lease stands.

**Why the socket must LISTEN, and why the option differs by platform.** Binding alone
does not hold a port against the binders that matter here: this repo's own availability
probe sets ``SO_REUSEADDR`` (:func:`kiro_crew.instances.port_allocator._port_free`) and
so does OpenSSH's forward listener, and on POSIX a second ``SO_REUSEADDR`` bind against
a socket that is bound but NOT listening SUCCEEDS. Only a listening socket refuses it
with ``EADDRINUSE``.

On Windows the option itself inverts: ``SO_REUSEADDR`` there lets another process steal
an ACTIVE listener, so setting it would give away the ownership this class exists to
hold, and merely omitting it is not enough because the other process can set it on its
own socket. ``SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`` is the opt-in that makes the bind exclusive. This is
the same branch, for the same reason, as :mod:`kiro_crew.browser_cli.view` and the
dashboard's own listener -- an earlier revision of this module set ``SO_REUSEADDR``
unconditionally and held nothing at all on Windows while claiming otherwise.

**Why it accepts, and why it never reads.** Because the socket has to listen, the TCP
handshake completes, so a stale client WILL transmit its request -- "the token is
never sent" is not reachable once listening is mandatory. What is reachable is that
nothing ever reads it. Two shapes were measured:

* Listen and never accept: the connection completes and then sits in the accept
  queue, request and credential buffered in the kernel, until the client times out.
  The pane HANGS, and every queued connection is holding a credential that any later
  accept would hand over.
* Accept immediately, never read, close with ``SO_LINGER`` 0: the credential's
  residence is bounded by the instant between accept and close, no queue of
  credential-bearing connections accumulates, and ``SO_LINGER`` 0 makes the close an
  RST rather than a FIN, so the failure is unambiguous rather than an empty body a
  client might mistake for a valid reply.

The second is chosen: it is both the safer shape and the kinder one. **A stale pane
dialling a held port sees its connection RESET at once** (``ECONNRESET``), not a hang
and not an empty success.

A deliberately blunt refusal: answering something courteous like ``410 Gone`` would
mean draining the request first, and the request carries the credential. The whole
point is that no code here touches it, so the connection is refused unread.

**The window this does not close.** The forward must release the port before this can
bind it, so there is an interval between those two operations during which the port is
briefly free. It is the gap between two adjacent statements rather than the hours the
lease would otherwise stand unenforced, and closing it entirely would need the kernel
to transfer the binding, which it offers no way to do.
