"""Inbound SSH tunnel manager for the Instances feature.

Adapts the supervised-child + state-machine design of
``kiro_crew.tunnel.manager.TunnelManager`` (which points *outward* to expose the
dashboard) to point *inward*: for each connected remote instance it supervises a
local child process that forwards a loopback port to the remote Kiro Crew's
dashboard port, over one of two transports (``Instance.connection_method``):

* ``"ssh"`` (default): ``ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>``.
* ``"ssm"``: ``aws ssm start-session --document-name
  AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --target <ssm_target> --parameters
  portNumber=RP,localPortNumber=LP`` — no inbound SSH port or SSH key needed,
  only IAM (``ssm:StartSession``) and the SSM agent on the remote box.

Design note: a literal ``ssh -fN`` would make ssh fork into the background and
the foreground process exit immediately, which would leave the gateway unable to
supervise or kill the real forwarder. A gateway-supervised child must stay in the
foreground, so we use ``-N`` (no remote command) *without* ``-f``, mirroring how
``TunnelManager`` supervises its own child. Connection multiplexing is pinned
off in the argv (``ControlPath=none``) for the same reason: it lets a user's
``~/.ssh/config`` recreate that fork-and-exit shape from outside this module.
``ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`` ensures
ssh exits if the local forward can't be bound, so a failed connect is detected
rather than hanging. The SSM transport gets the equivalent detection from the
generic ready-poll (:meth:`_Tunnel._wait_until_ready`) plus a post-hoc ownership
recheck, since the ``session-manager-plugin`` child does not expose an
``ExitOnForwardFailure``-style flag.

Scope (Phase 1 / Stage 4): connect, disconnect, status, and shutdown-all, with
port allocation + token mint wired in. The health-probe loop and 2-tier
self-heal are Phase 3 — this module exposes clean seams (an ``on_exit`` hook and
a per-instance state machine) for that follow-up without implementing it here.
SSM support reuses every one of those seams — it is a second *transport* plugged
into the same tunnel/state-machine/self-heal/token-refresh code, not a parallel
implementation.

Security (standard practices): loopback-bound forwards only (never ``0.0.0.0``);
child spawned via argv list (no local shell) for both transports; ``ssh_host`` /
``remote_bin`` (SSH) and ``ssm_target`` / ``aws_profile`` / ``aws_region`` (SSM)
injection-validated before use; minted tokens held in memory only and never
logged.

        the far end and back, which is what a zombie forward cannot produce: it

        container authorises before it routes and would log a ``control`` deny
        for each probe, so the right path keeps the probe silent in its logs.
        Only a timeout or a connection error (no response at all) is a failure;

    window at in-process microseconds, the same residual the repo's other

    Identity is pid + start time + exact argv, checked in that order, and the
    start-time comparison is RE-RUN before the destructive SIGKILL: the grace
    window is exactly the interval in which the pid can exit and be recycled,
    and ``pid_exists`` polling cannot observe an exit that is immediately

    reaps the ``session-manager-plugin`` grandchild still holding the

    port actually releasing, so a wrapper that exits first cannot fake
    success while the plugin keeps the port. If the group leader is already

    existing pid-keyed helpers; the TERM broadcast has already reached every

    DEAD gateway's process group, where a group signal could hit unrelated
    survivors — so it gets a pid-scoped signal only, which suffices because
    ``ssh -N`` holds the forward itself and spawns no descendants of its own.

        A SIGKILLed gateway never runs teardown, so its forwarder child
        survives, reparented to init with nothing left to reap it: one idle
        process, one loopback port, and one live session to the remote per
        hard-kill → reconnect cycle. The restarted manager finds the recorded
        ``local_port`` occupied and (correctly) allocates around it; this hook
        is what turns that permanent leak into a reclaim.

        Reclamation is keyed on OUR OWN recorded identity, never a
        process-table match — matching the table by argv pattern would
        SIGTERM forwards operators opened themselves, and no
        pattern can distinguish our child from a stranger's. The registry
        itself is agent-writable, so a recorded claim is honored only when it
        AUTHENTICATES: the record must carry the gateway's own MAC over
        (instance id, pid, start time, port), computed at spawn under a key
        derived from the SEL trust root — which an agent can neither read nor
        replace — so a record written or re-pointed by anything but this
        gateway fails verification outright. Behind the MAC, defense in depth
        from kernel-owned facts: the candidate must be a genuine ORPHAN — not
        a pid this manager currently supervises, and reparented to init
        (``get_ppid == 1``), which no live gateway's forwarder is. Then the
        recorded pid is trusted only behind a STRICT identity check, both
        halves recorded at spawn: the pid's start time must equal the recorded
        ``forwarder_start``, AND its full argv must exactly equal the forward
        command line this manager would construct for the recorded port (host
        and all). Anything less — either hint missing, process gone,
        attributes unreadable, or any element differing — means the identity
        cannot be confirmed: the process is left alone and connect falls
        through to normal allocation. The start-time half is what defeats pid
        recycling (argv can collide in principle; a recycled pid's start time
        cannot), and it is re-verified before the SIGKILL escalation inside
        the worker. Best-effort: a failed reclaim never fails the connect, it
        only leaves the leak for the next attempt.

        A rebuilt-vs-recorded argv can also drift apart without any foul play
        (an edited compression/host setting, or an ``aws`` entrypoint the
        kernel rewrites through a shebang) — that misses the reclaim, never
        mis-kills, and is logged below so the miss is visible instead of
        silent.

        acquire would never complete while the caller's own frame holds it -- a
        connect that hangs forever holding the lock, wedging every later connect,
        disconnect and self-heal.

        So this stores directly, and must be correct whether or not a lock is
        held, because its three callers differ: :meth:`connect` holds the lock
        across the mint, while :meth:`_refresh_token_once` and the self-heal's
        tier-2 mint deliberately do not. What makes the store safe in all three is
        the tunnel GENERATION, captured before the mint and compared after: an
        unheld lock lets the parent be disconnected and reconnected during a mint
        budget measured in tens of seconds, and membership alone cannot see that
        -- the new tunnel satisfies it, so the fresh credential would be
        overwritten by one minted against the generation before it.

        Returns ``False`` for every "cannot", leaving the 401 to be raised as a
        mint failure: a parent mid-reconfiguration, one that is not connected,
        coordinates that do not validate, a mint the parent's own remote refused,
        and a parent whose tunnel was replaced while this mint was in flight.

        A NARROW carrier, like :meth:`peer_capability`: the path is built here from
        the crew's id IN THE PARENT's registry, never supplied by a caller, and the
        only body field is the port this gateway serves its own dashboard on. It
        runs over the parent's already-open forward with the parent's port-scoped
        cookie, so:

        * the parent's credential never leaves this object and never reaches the
          browser — the pane's postMessage relay only ever carries "crew X is up
          on my port N", which is why a chained pane can be announced by untrusted
          frame code at all;
        * the minted token is the CHILD's, issued by the child's own gateway over
          the hop the parent owns, and it carries our embed parent port so the
          child's CSP admits this gateway's page as the pane's frame ancestor. The
          parent's own token for that child is untouched, so the parent's pane for
          it keeps working.

        A 401/403 gets exactly one transparent re-mint of the PARENT's credential
        and one retry, matching every other peer call here. That re-mint goes
        through :meth:`_remint_parent_under_lock` rather than the public refresh,
        because one of the two callers DOES hold the manager lock: ``connect``
        holds it across the mint, while the self-heal's tier-2 mint deliberately
        runs without it (see the "slow remote I/O WITHOUT the lock" phase). A
        lock-taking refresh would deadlock the first caller, so the store is
        gated on the tunnel generation instead, which is correct either way.
        That unheld lock is also why this method re-reads the parent's forward
        before spending the credential; see :meth:`_require_peer_forward`.
        Raises :class:`TokenMintError` on anything else, so the caller's existing
        mint-failure handling applies unchanged.

        The counterpart of :meth:`_mint_through_parent`, from this side of the hop:
        a hub that reaches this crew by riding our forward has no key for it, so we
        mint over the transport we already hold and hand the token back, carrying
        the HUB's dashboard port as the embed-parent claim rather than our own.

        No CREDENTIAL is stored. The token we keep for this crew is the one OUR pane
        loads with, and overwriting it with one scoped to someone else's page would
        break our own pane for the crew we just helped somebody else reach.

        One thing IS recorded: the hop we lent and when the token we issued against
        it expires, in the registry document's own port-keyed lease table (see
        :meth:`InstanceRegistry.lend_hop`). Until that moment the port is withheld
        from allocation -- see :meth:`_reserved_ports` -- because the hub rides the
        port NUMBER, and handing that number to another crew while the hub's token
        is still valid is what delivers one crew's credential to a different crew's
        gateway. It is kept on the DOCUMENT and not on this crew's row because
        removing the crew deletes its row while the hub's token stays live. The
        deadline is the TTL we issued, so this asks nothing of the hub and is not a
        lease.

        Returns ``(ok, payload)``. On success the payload carries the ``token``, the
        loopback ``port`` our own forward listens on, which is the hop the hub
        forwards to, and the ``ttl`` the token was issued under -- OUR record's TTL
        for this crew, which the hub cannot know and must not assume: its own row
        for the crew defaults to 20h, and scheduling a refresh from that would put
        the refresh after a shorter token has already expired. The token and the
        port are one claim, not two facts: the mint is a multi-second round trip
        taken without the manager lock, so the hop is read once before it and
        confirmed unmoved after, and a hop that moved is refused rather than
        answered. On failure the payload carries ``error`` / ``code`` plus the HTTP
        ``status`` the route should answer with, so the handler translates without
        string-matching.

        Idempotent: connecting an already-connected instance returns its current
        status. Raises :class:`KeyError` for an unknown instance, or surfaces a
        validation / mint / spawn error via the returned status (state ERROR).
        Works for either ``connection_method`` — the transport is resolved by
        :meth:`_resolve_transport`.

        ``rebuild=True`` breaks the idempotence on purpose: a CONNECTED tunnel is
        torn down first (``keep_intent`` — the user is asking for the crew, not
        turning it off) and a fresh forwarder is spawned on a DIFFERENT local
        port: the port just freed is excluded from the allocation, so both a
        stalled stream on the old forwarder and a cause bound to the old port
        itself are escaped by one Retry. This is the pane's Retry after a load watchdog
        fired on a document that DID navigate: the transport is up by every
        probe the manager runs (``/api/health`` answers, the credential
        validates), yet one stream inside it stalled and the pane's module
        graph will wait on it forever. Nothing short of a new TCP path clears
        that, and the plain connect — which sees CONNECTED and returns — would
        hand the same stalled tunnel back.

        A teardown that fails (the stop raises) is reported as an ERROR status,
        the same way every other connect failure is: the live tunnel is left
        exactly as :meth:`_teardown_locked` leaves it (intact — nothing is
        removed unless the stop succeeded), the reason is retained for
        :meth:`last_error`, and the caller gets a 502 with a message instead of
        a propagated exception turned into an unexplained 500.

        ``only_if_connected=True`` is the opposite restriction: answer a
        CONNECTED tunnel exactly like the plain connect (its status, its cached
        token) but, when the tunnel is not up, spawn nothing and touch nothing
        -- return a DISCONNECTED status and leave ``was_connected`` as the user
        last set it. This is the viewport's auto-warm, whose job is to pre-mount
        panes for tunnels that are ALREADY up, never to bring one up. The check
        runs under the manager lock, the same lock :meth:`disconnect` holds
        while it stops a tunnel, so an auto-warm racing a disconnect either sees
        the tunnel still CONNECTED (and warms a pane the disconnect's
        ``removeWarm`` then drops) or sees it gone and stands down; it can never
        re-open a tunnel the user just closed, which a probe-then-connect from
        the browser could.

            # port survives a gateway RESTART, and the auto-revive on the next

        ``keep_intent`` distinguishes a RECONFIGURATION from a user disconnect.
        ``was_connected`` records that the user wants this instance connected, so
        only an explicit disconnect may clear it; a caller tearing a tunnel down
        in order to rebuild it (an edit that changes the host or port) passes
        ``keep_intent=True`` and leaves that flag alone. Restoring the flag
        afterwards instead would race a real disconnect arriving mid-edit and
        silently revive the instance the user just turned off.

        The persisted ``local_port`` is reset to the unallocated sentinel here —
        symmetric with :meth:`connect` setting it — so a disconnected instance
        never leaves a stale port recorded. Without this the freed port reads as
        perpetually reserved (``_reserved_ports`` / the ``local_port == 0``
        "unallocated" contract), and the instance can't be reconnected. The
        registry cleanup runs even when no live tunnel is tracked, so a port left
        behind by an unclean prior exit can still be cleared by a disconnect.

        A crew that other crews are CHAINED behind takes them down with it, and
        this is where that happens: their forwards ride this one's hop, so leaving
        them up would leave a forward pointing at a port on a machine this gateway

        ``connect()`` replaces *mine* (stopping it), or a ``disconnect`` tears
        it down — either way the record this write would make is about a
        tunnel that is not current, and persisting ``was_connected=True`` over
        a disconnect's ``False`` would silently revive, across restarts, an
        instance the user turned off. *expected_epoch* is the Phase 1 stamp
        plus the installs this recovery made itself; teardown bumps the stamp
        too, so any interleaved install OR teardown reads as a mismatch and
        the record is refused. Nothing needs unwinding on refusal: every
        displacing path stops the tunnel it displaces, so *mine* is already
        down and untracked.

        Persist the forwarder identity hints, under lock, iff still tracked.
        The attempt counter is NOT reset here — a bind-only rebuild does not
        prove the forward reaches its far end; the reset lives on a proven
        end-to-end probe success (see :meth:`_probe_loop`).

        A rebuild replaced the tunnel child, so the recorded forwarder
        identity (``forwarder_pid`` + ``forwarder_start`` + the
        ``local_port`` that child is bound to) must move with
        ``was_connected`` — a stale identity would point a later hard-kill
        reclaim at a process that does not exist (harmless, the identity
        check refuses it) while the ACTUAL replacement child leaked
        unrecorded. All hints go in one write.

        The record comes from :meth:`_forwarder_identity_hints`, so this write
        carries exactly the fields :meth:`connect`'s does and the pair cannot
        drift apart. ``local_port`` matters twice over here. A rebuild takes
        its port from the LIVE tunnel (see :meth:`_recover`), which may differ
        from the recorded one. And ``forwarder_sig`` is a MAC over the port, so
        recording a pid against a different port than the one it was signed
        with leaves the signature failing verification — the reclaim then
        refuses the very child this write exists to record, and every consumer
        reading the recorded port (the pane URL, :meth:`diagnose`'s fallback)
        addresses a port nothing is listening on.

        The persist stays INSIDE the manager lock so write order equals
        lock-acquisition order: a concurrent :meth:`disconnect`'s
        ``was_connected=False`` (also written under the lock) can never be
        overwritten by this recovery write landing late. The tracked-check
        gates the persist — an instance the user disconnected must not be
        re-marked auto-reconnectable. ``_persist_hint`` keeps the lock held
        until the worker write completes even under cancellation; a cancelled
        bare ``to_thread`` await would NOT stop the already-running thread, so
        its write could land after the lock released and break the ordering.

        refusal payload (``error`` + ``code``) that is returned unsent: a large
        session serialises for long enough that the caller's own checks on the
        source (its privacy line) can go stale in between.

        Returns ``(ok, payload)``: on success *payload* is the peer's JSON reply
        (carrying the new session key); on failure it carries ``error`` and a
        machine-readable ``code`` so the caller can tell a stale token from an
        unreachable peer from a bundle the peer refused from a peer too old to
        have an importer at all.

        Runs entirely over the already-open forward — **no SSH spawn**, same as
        :meth:`token_validates`.

        **The token never leaves this object** — see
        :meth:`_peer_cookie_header`, which owns that rule for every peer request.
