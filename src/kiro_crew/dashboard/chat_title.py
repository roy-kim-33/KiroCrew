    opening pleasantry, and a session that fell back to the truncated first
    message keeps that truncation forever. Fired from ``chat_done`` (same
    call site as the initial titling), this re-runs the background ``_bg``
    one-liner at the ``_TITLE_REFRESH_MILESTONES`` user-turn marks, or every
    ``dashboard.title_refresh_every_turns`` user turns when that cadence is
    set, and swaps the sidebar title when the model says the old one no
    longer fits.

    Token discipline (the whole point of doing this in the background instead
    of exposing a title tool to every chat):

    - Only ``title_origin == "auto"`` titles are ever refreshed. A manual
      rename is final; legacy titles with no stored origin rehydrate as "user"
      and are equally final.
    - Each milestone fires at most ONCE, attempt-counted: a KEEP/SKIP/prose
      reply or an error consumes it (no retries). On the built-in schedule the
      two ordinary milestones plus the low-signal early milestone are at most
      three extra one-liner calls over a session's whole lifetime, and the
      early one only exists for sessions whose title locked as a URL/ticket-key
      echo or as the truncated first-message fallback (see
      ``_is_low_signal_title``). The opt-in cadence has no such cap: it spends
      one call per N user turns, attempt-counted the same way, for as many
      turns as the session holds (see ``_title_refresh_due``).
    - The consumed mark is persisted (``title_refresh_mark``) so a gateway
      restart cannot re-spend it.
    - The prompt is bounded exactly like the initial titling prompt (ten
      200-char lines) and offers a one-token KEEP reply for the common
      nothing-changed case.
