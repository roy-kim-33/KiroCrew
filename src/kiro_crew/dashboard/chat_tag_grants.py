"""Agent tag-write grants — protected identity and policy for ``chat_tag``.

A tag's agent-write policy (``add-remove`` | ``add-only`` | ``none``) decides
whether the ``chat_tag`` session directive may mutate that tag on a session.
``tags.json`` is agent-writable, so neither policy nor trusted tag identity can
come from its rows. The authorization record lives instead in
``<data home>/tag-grants/agent-tag-policy.json``, a dedicated leaf masked from
sandboxed processes and fenced from agent file tools and shell. Only the
gateway opens it directly.

Authenticated dashboard create records an identity row for every new tag:
``none``/non-status for a plain label and ``add-remove``/status for a workflow
state. PATCH may change policy or status only when that row already exists; the
dashboard-owner adoption action records a ``none`` row for a legacy tag, and
delete revokes it. Boot seeding reads only code-constant workflow-state ids,
never ``tags.json``. A pre-existing custom tag without a row remains human-only
until explicit dashboard-owner adoption.

Each row records the protected STATUS bit used by set_state eligibility,
mutual-exclusivity stripping, and the no-status-tag-through-add rule. An absent,
unreadable, malformed, or newer-schema store fails closed to
``("none", False)``. A legitimate custom tag whose protected identity is lost
requires explicit owner adoption; honoring a forged row hands the agent a
human-reserved tag.

#: (``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` + pre-created via
#: ``_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES``) and fenced from agent file tools by
#: ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``. NOT ``trust/``: that directory must stay
#: sandbox read-write (``_CREW_SANDBOX_VISIBLE_LEAVES`` — the SEL log appends
#: and ``sel_hmac.key`` reads happen in-sandbox), so an authorization store
#: living there is forgeable by a spawned agent script's plain ``open()``,
#: which never routes through the file-tool gate. Only the GATEWAY process
#: reads or writes grants, so the mask breaks no consumer. Top-level because a
#: mask covers the leaf, not its ancestors.
_STORE_SUBDIR = "tag-grants"

#: There is deliberately NO read of any other location — in particular no
#: migration from ``trust/``. That directory is sandbox read-write, so a file
#: there can only be agent-planted (no shipped build writes grants anywhere
#: but this store), and promoting its bytes into the protected store would
#: hand an in-sandbox forgery real authorization on the next boot. Grants are
#: minted exclusively through the authenticated dashboard CRUD and the
#: trusted-constant seeding below.

_MAX_STORE_KEY_BYTES = 4096

#: Upper bound on the grants document. ``_MAX_GRANT_ROWS`` rows of the widest

_MAX_STORE_BYTES = 2 * 1024 * 1024

#: The policies a store row may carry. ``none`` rows record protected
#: dashboard-create identity without granting write authority; for workflow
#: states they also preserve the STATUS bit used by exclusivity semantics.

#: state, but is not provenance for a later PATCH mint.
_ROW_POLICIES = frozenset({"add-remove", "add-only", "none"})

    Runs at boot when the store file does not exist. Rows are minted solely
    for the ids passed in — the caller supplies the DEFAULT workflow-state tag
    ids from the code-level seed vocabulary. ``tags.json`` is never an identity
    source because promoting its rows would turn agent-controlled data into
    authorization. A pre-existing custom tag therefore requires explicit
    dashboard-owner adoption, which is the migration cost of not laundering the
    file's contents into the trust store. Returns True when a store was written;
    never overwrites a store that verifies.

    This is also the store's RECOVERY AUTHORITY, run before any resolver
    traffic. Decisions, in order:

    - The store directory is realized via :func:`_store_dir` FIRST, which
      removes a link or junction planted at the directory name — every read
      and every quarantine rename below happens inside a real directory, so
      a planted link can never carry a rename to an arbitrary target.
    - An UNCERTIFIED store key is quarantined together with the store, and
      trusted constants are reseeded. This covers a token-key rotation too:
      at that moment a legitimate store and a planted self-signed one are
      indistinguishable, so the fail-closed answer is the only safe one, and
      custom tag identity is restored only by explicit dashboard-owner adoption.
    - A store whose rows fail verification under the certified key is
      quarantined and reseeded from trusted constants: forged rows stop
      resolving on the very boot that finds them, not when a human notices.
    - The reseed is READ BACK and verified before authenticated writes may
      land on it (:func:`_mark_reseed_verified`). The quarantine keeps
      REDUCING grants for the process (:func:`store_degraded`), but the
      dashboard-owner adoption that restores a custom tag's identity works on
      this same boot rather than after a restart (:func:`store_write_blocked`).
