"""Agent tag-write grants — the protected policy source for ``chat_tag``.

A tag's agent-write policy (``add-remove`` | ``add-only`` | ``none``) decides
whether the ``chat_tag`` session directive may mutate that tag on a session.
Storing that policy as fields on the tag rows in ``tags.json`` left it
agent-writable: ``tags.json`` is an ordinary data-home file, so an agent's own
file tools could forge ``agent``/``status`` fields, restart-persistently
granting itself write access to a human-reserved tag (forgeable-authorization hazard on the
``chat_tag`` PR). Same class of control as ``computer_use.json``: the record IS
the authorization, so it cannot live where the subject of the authorization can
write it.

This module is the protected replacement. Grants live in
``<data home>/tag-grants/agent-tag-policy.json`` — a dedicated leaf that is
masked from sandboxed processes (``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``) AND fenced
from the agent file tools and shell (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``), so
neither a gated tool call nor a spawned script's plain ``open()`` can read or
forge it; only the gateway opens the path, directly.

Writers are the authenticated dashboard tag CRUD handlers only (create/update/
delete mint and revoke rows), plus a one-time boot seed that mints rows solely
for the CODE-CONSTANT default workflow-state tag ids — never anything read
from ``tags.json``, whose contents are agent-writable and therefore must not
be promoted into this store. A pre-existing custom grant requires one
authenticated dashboard PATCH after upgrade to re-mint.

Each grant row also records the tag's STATUS bit (is this a workflow-state
tag?). The applier's status semantics — set_state eligibility, the
mutual-exclusivity peer strip, the "no status tags through add" rule — key on
this recorded bit rather than the file's, because a forged ``status`` field
on a granted tag would otherwise re-route those authorization decisions.

The gate fails **closed** everywhere: an unreadable store, a malformed store,
an unknown tag id, or a newer schema all resolve to ``("none", False)`` rather
than a permissive default. Refusing a legitimate grant costs one dashboard
click to re-mint; honoring a forged one hands the agent a human-reserved tag.

    Runs at boot when the store file does not exist. Rows are minted solely
    for the ids passed in — the caller supplies the DEFAULT workflow-state tag
    ids from the code-level seed vocabulary, never anything read from
    ``tags.json``. An earlier revision derived rows from the live vocabulary's
    legacy fields; that would amount to promoting
    agent-controlled data into authorization (edit the file before the
    upgrade, get a protected grant after it), so file-derived seeding is gone:
    a pre-existing custom grant now requires one authenticated dashboard PATCH
    to re-mint, which is the migration cost of not laundering the file's
    contents into the trust store. Returns True when a store was written;
    never overwrites a store that verifies.

    This is also the store's RECOVERY AUTHORITY, run before any resolver
    traffic. Decisions, in order:

    - The store directory is realized via :func:`_store_dir` FIRST, which
      removes a link or junction planted at the directory name — every read
      and every quarantine rename below happens inside a real directory, so
      a planted link can never carry a rename to an arbitrary target.
    - An UNCERTIFIED store key is quarantined together with the store, and
      trusted constants are reseeded. This covers a token-key rotation too:
      at that moment a legitimate store and a planted self-signed one are
      indistinguishable, so the fail-closed answer is the only safe one, and
      grants are restored by authenticated re-minting.
    - A store whose rows fail verification under the certified key is
      quarantined and reseeded from trusted constants: forged rows stop
      resolving on the very boot that finds them, not when a human notices.
