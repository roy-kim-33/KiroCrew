"""How an in-memory slot row becomes a persisted transcript line, and back.

``_build_message_entry_uncached`` is the one projection a dashboard save applies to
every window row: transient roles drop, non-user content is redacted, inline images
are copied into the session's attachment store and the row is pointed at the copy,
provenance is carried, and blocked-link records ride only with the text they
describe. ``_attach_variants`` is the load-side counterpart for a row's alternate
replies, and ``_approx_window_payload_bytes`` the cheap size bound a save checks
before it routes a window through the memo. The memo itself
(``_build_message_entry``) and its process-wide cache state stay in
``chat_persistence``.

New fields a persisted row carries, or new redaction a row needs, belong here.
