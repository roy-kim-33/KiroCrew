"""The bytes a dashboard save writes: frozen prefix, live window, foreign lines.

A session file is a frozen prefix (the on-disk lines older than the in-memory
window, never rewritten) followed by the window, re-serialized in full on every
save. This module owns how those become one payload: reading and caching the
prefix, finding the lines another writer appended into the window region and
merging them back in time order, and archiving what a save drops -- the ambiguous
dedup folds and a rewrite's truncated tail. ``_save_slot_to_history`` holds the
transcript lock around it and does the atomic replace.

New rules about what a save keeps from the file it replaces belong here.

    """Return ``(frozen_prefix, foreign_lines, dedup_dropped)`` for a save.

    ``frozen_prefix`` is the verbatim bytes of the first *disk_older* on-disk
    message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window. They are never
    rewritten, so older history survives a restart that only loaded a recent
    window. The bytes are cached on the slot keyed by ``(mtime, size,
    disk_older)`` so a steady 5s flush is O(window) rather than O(file size).

    ``foreign_lines`` are on-disk message lines in the WINDOW region (the bytes
    after the frozen prefix) that this slot's in-memory *window_entries* do NOT
    represent — i.e. acknowledged appends made by ANOTHER process (subagent /
    cron / CLI) that this slot never saw. ``_save_slot_to_history`` captures its
    ``window`` snapshot BEFORE taking ``_locked``, so a cross-process writer can
    fully append + release between the snapshot and this save acquiring the lock;
    a bare ``meta + frozen + window`` replace would then silently delete that
    acknowledged message. Carrying these lines into the payload makes the save
    non-destructive against cross-process appends. Identity is **id-first**: a
    disk line whose ``meta.mid`` (read via :func:`row_mid`) matches a window
    entry's id, corroborated by body or ``ts`` (same ``(role, content)`` — a
    durable copy — or same ``ts`` — an in-place edit), IS that entry's
    persisted copy, so it is dropped silently (the window re-serializes it)
    and never archived. The corroboration is required because ``meta.mid`` is
    caller-suppliable (``_ChatSlot.append`` preserves a pre-existing id), so a
    bare id equality could pair two genuinely distinct messages; an id match
    with NO corroborating entry falls back to the legacy ladder as if id-less,
    which typically preserves the line. A disk line whose ``meta.mid`` matches
    NO available window entry is a foreign append regardless of body equality,
    which is what tells two genuinely distinct identical-content messages
    apart — it still keeps its ``ts`` group ambiguous for the ts-only tier, so
    its presence can never convert a contested group into a silent id-less
    fold. Only an **id-less** disk line resolves
    through the legacy timestamp-first ladder, unchanged: it is treated as
    ours when
    its ``ts`` matches a window entry (covers in-place edits, which keep ``ts``
    but change content) OR — as a COUNT-BOUNDED tiebreak — its
    ``(role, content)`` matches an as-yet-unconsumed window entry (covers a
    same-process ``append_if_absent`` copy persisted with a FRESH ``ts``
    distinct from the window entry's in-memory ``ts``). The tiebreak is bounded
    so each window entry absorbs AT MOST ONE disk copy: if the on-disk window
    region holds two id-less lines with identical ``(role, content)`` but
    distinct timestamps — the window's own persisted copy PLUS a genuinely
    distinct event from another process (e.g. a repeated identical cron /
    workflow result) — only the first is folded into the window and the second
    is preserved as a foreign append. A plain ``(role, content)`` set collapsed
    those two real events into one; the bounded, timestamp-first identity
    fixes it for id-less lines, and the ``meta.mid`` tier resolves it exactly
    for stamped lines (see also ``docs/system-specs/modules/history.md``).
    ``dedup_dropped`` returns any fresh-``ts`` content-tiebreak drops so the
    caller can route them through the archive — even the residual ambiguous
    case (an id-less distinct message indistinguishable from an
    ``append_if_absent`` copy without a stable id) then loses no data
    permanently. A corroborated id-matched fold is NOT such a drop: the ids
    plus body/``ts`` agreeing makes it unambiguous, so it does not churn the
    archive.

    Fast path: when BOTH the on-disk mtime AND size match the frozen-prefix
    cache, THIS slot was the last writer and nothing has landed since, so the
    prefix is served from cache and the foreign lines preserved by the previous
    save are re-emitted verbatim from cache — the O(file) read/scan runs ONLY
    when the file changed on disk since our last write. Size is part of the key
    because an append always grows the file even inside a single coarse mtime
    tick, so mtime alone is not a safe change signal for a data-loss guard.
    Re-emitting the cached foreign lines (rather than assuming there are none)
    is what makes the fast path non-destructive: a previous save may have
    preserved a cross-process append INTO the on-disk window region, and since
    ``disk_older`` is unchanged those preserved lines would otherwise be dropped
    by a bare frozen-prefix + in-memory-window rebuild on the very next save.

    Returns ``("", [])`` when the file is missing/unreadable/has no metadata line.
