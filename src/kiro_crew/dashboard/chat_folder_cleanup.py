"""Bulk delete of sidebar folders that hold no live session.

``POST /api/chat/folders/cleanup`` is the folder twin of the session cleanup
(``/api/chat/slots/cleanup``): a dry run lists what would go, a second call
deletes it. It exists because agents file their worker sessions into folders
they create on the fly (``<goal>/<agent>``), so a busy sidebar collects dozens
of folders whose sessions have all closed. Deleting them one by one through the
row menu does not scale, and hiding them only moves the clutter out of sight.

A folder is removable when nothing that still runs would notice it going:

* no LIVE session is filed in it or anywhere below it, and no saved cron job
  files its tab into it or anywhere below it (the job keeps the folder's id,
  so recreating the folder by name would not bring the filing back),
* none of its rows carries a setting the person chose (project directory,
  default agent, steering directories, tags, color, icon), and
* it is not a channel folder: neither one stamped for a channel nor one whose
  name a channel's ``session_folder`` setting names. Inbound channel sessions
  are filed by looking that name up, and only a settings save creates the
  folder again, so deleting it would leave every later channel session
  unfiled.

Archived sessions do not keep a folder. Deleting the folder leaves them in
Older Sessions, unfiled, the same as the single-folder delete does: a
``folder_id`` that names no folder is ignored when the history is read.

Top-level folders are spared unless the request asks for them. They are the
ones a person usually made by hand, while the deep ones are what agents leave
behind.
