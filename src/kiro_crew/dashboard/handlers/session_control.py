"""Routes behind the session-control MCP tools.

Strict-internal (loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``): no browser calls these, and
they are the entry point to acting on another live conversation, so a cookie
fall-through would be a genuinely new path rather than a convenience.

The handlers do parsing and status mapping only — resolution, authorization and
the operations themselves live in ``dashboard/session_control.py`` so the verbs

    Runs only on the authenticated strict-internal branch (``internal_auth`` is
    ``True``). Resolves the caller's private authority ONCE via
    :func:`internal_memory_scope`:

    * a verification failure returns that refusal verbatim
      (``member_session_unverified``);
    * an owner / Global-V1 caller (``scope is None``) falls through to the
      handler, exactly as the surface behaved before member dispatch existed;
    * a verified private V2 caller is admitted ONLY when it is a crew-member DM
      slot (``member-*`` session key) AND the surface is reachable for it — the
      member operating model, gated the rest of the way by
      ``session_control.py``'s own creator-ownership fence. Every other private
      V2 caller gets the ``member_scope_denied`` refusal.

    Reachable means ``member_dispatch_enabled()`` OR ``session_control_enabled()``
    is true, mirroring ``session_control.py``'s ``_member_bypass`` contract: the
    ``member_dispatch`` ceiling is a bypass ON TOP of the global switch, not a
    replacement for it. With ``member_dispatch`` off a member falls back UNDER
    the global switch (``_member_bypass``'s docstring and session-control.md
    "Member callers"), so a member is admitted whenever the switch is on even
    though its own bypass is withdrawn — refusing it there would put a member
    OUT of the surface the operator left open to everyone, not merely strip its
    bypass. Both reads run off the loop and fail closed on an unreadable config,
    so this gate can never open wider than the two switches behind it. The
    refusal is emitted through :func:`member_scope_denied_refusal` — the same

    These paths are on ``_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``, but strict is not

    through to cookie auth, and a ``local_only=False`` deployment reclassifies
    every strict path as "mixed". Either way a same-origin page holding only a
    dashboard cookie could reach here and — by choosing ``X-Session-Key`` —
    message, stop, or read any of the user's sessions AS one of them. The
    session key is an identity claim these routes authorize on, so it has to be
    backed by the secret rather than by whatever a browser sends.

    ``internal_auth`` is set only after a constant-time secret match, so
    requiring it closes the cookie path, the app-token path, and the
    non-loopback reclassification in one check. Returns the refusal, or ``None``

    A private crew-member DM slot is the ONE verified V2 caller admitted here

    bypass, OR the global ``agent.session_control`` switch it otherwise falls
