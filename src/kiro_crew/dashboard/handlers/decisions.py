"""Decision-seam REST API -- the operator's switch for Jev egress, and the strip.

``GET  /api/decisions/consent``   the keystone plus the endpoint config names now
``PUT  /api/decisions/consent``   ``{"enabled": bool}`` -> writes it, bound to that endpoint
                                 plus the ``tool_args`` / ``compaction`` /
                                 ``memory_text`` egress scopes,
                                 each preserved when its field is omitted
``POST /api/decisions/feedback``  a person's verdict on one turn -> one appended log row

Consent is bound to a destination: enabling records the provider endpoint the
config names at that moment, and the gate sends only while the two still agree.
The GET returns both so the card can show the owner WHERE consent would send, and
say so when a later config edit moved the destination out from under it.

Above the owner's switch sits the FLEET's: ``capabilities.decisions``
(``decisions/capability.py``). The two answer different questions -- may my messages
be sent, versus may this machine run the seam at all -- so a managed install can
have an owner who consented in good faith to an endpoint the fleet never approved.
A denial refuses an ENABLING PUT with ``403 decisions_capability_denied``, and both
verbs fold it into ``permits`` so no caller reads "a decision would be sent" under a
pin. A DISABLING PUT still succeeds under a denial: the gate already treats the seam
as off, and refusing the write would trap an owner with a stale ``"enabled": true``
keystone they cannot clear.

This handler is the ONLY writer of ``decisions_consent.json``, and that is what
makes "the agent cannot switch on the egress of its own conversation" true: the
keystone leaf is on ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` and mounted read-only in
every sandbox, and this handler opens the path directly rather than through the
agent tool gate. The same shape as ``handlers/aws_consent.py``, for the same
class of decision: consent to send the operator's data to a paid external
service.

**Dashboard OWNER only**, on the read as well as the write, and on all four
routes. An app token would otherwise let an agent that can author an app manifest
mint a token and flip the switch it cannot write as a file; a Slack allow-listed
non-owner authenticates with ``app == ""`` and would otherwise consent on the
owner's behalf. Reads are refused too so a non-owner cannot learn whether the
owner's messages are being sent off the machine.

The same gate covers the strip's two routes, for reasons of their own. The
feedback route is a WRITER of the decision log, so an app token that could reach
it could grow that file and pollute the record the operator reads; and the summary
route reports how the operator's own conversations were decided, which is the same
class of fact as whether they are being sent at all.

Blocking work is offloaded: the read and the atomic write touch the filesystem,
and the SEL audit can too when the boot-time warm failed, so none of them runs on
the event loop. Every outcome is audited, the successful read included.

The ``kiro_crew.decisions`` package is imported inside the handlers, not at module
top: this module is imported on the gateway boot path (``handlers/__init__``), and
the seam is an optional subsystem that is off until the owner consents, so its
import is paid on the first request that needs it (``no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path``).

    Enabling must ECHO the endpoint the owner reviewed (``endpoint`` in the body,
    the ``configured_endpoint`` the GET showed). The config is agent-writable, so
    between the owner's read and their click an agent could point
    ``provider.endpoint`` elsewhere; binding to what the server reads at PUT time
    would then consent to an address the owner never saw. A mismatch is ``409``
    and nothing is written; the card re-reads and shows the new address.

    ``enabled`` may be OMITTED, and then the body must name at least one scope. Such a
    write moves only that scope: the switch and the endpoint are read from the keystone
    inside the writer's lock and written back unchanged, so it can neither grant nor
    revoke consent. That is the only safe shape for a scope write, because a body
    carrying ``enabled`` can only carry what its sender last read -- and a view read
    before a revoke would turn egress back on. A body naming neither the switch nor a
    scope is a ``400``.

    A scope-only write against a REVOKED keystone leaves it revoked and stores no scope:
    a scope is only meaningful while the seam is on, which is the same rule that clears
    the scopes on a disabling write.

    ``tool_args`` records whether the owner consented to sending TOOL-CALL
    ARGUMENTS, the category ``tool.risk`` needs. Absent PRESERVES the recorded scope
    and disabling clears it, exactly as the ceiling below behaves, so an ordinary
    switch flip cannot grant or erase it by omission. Absent on a keystone that never
    had it reads as false, which is what keeps a consent given before this scope
    existed meaning only what its owner reviewed.

    ``compaction`` records the same thing for a WHOLE SLOT TRANSCRIPT -- the
    conversation text and every tool-call input in it -- which is what
    ``compaction.keep`` sends and neither of the other two scopes covers. It behaves
    identically: absent preserves, disabling clears, a non-boolean is a ``400``, and
    absent on a keystone that never had it reads as false. It is a field of its own
    rather than a wider reading of ``tool_args`` because the owner reviewed that one
    as the arguments of the one call about to run.

    ``memory_text`` records the same answer for the TEXT OF RECALLED MEMORIES, the
    category ``memory.recall`` needs, on identical terms. Independent fields because
    they are independent decisions: an owner may want risky tool calls flagged without
    the contents of their memory store leaving the machine, and any order of those
    answers has to be recordable.

    ``history_budget_chars`` records the prior-conversation CEILING the owner
    reviewed, and it is here for the same reason ``endpoint`` is: the value in force
    lives in agent-writable ``config.json``, so a budget recorded only there could be
    raised by the agent whose conversation would then be sent. The gate takes the
    smaller of the two.

    It is optional, and an omitted field PRESERVES the recorded ceiling rather than
    clearing it. The consent card sends ``enabled`` and ``endpoint`` only, so a
    default of 0 would make an ordinary switch flip erase a ceiling recorded through
    this same route. The two facts stay independent: the switch says whether the seam
    may send, the ceiling says how much prior conversation it may carry, and each
    moves only when its own field is present. Disabling still clears the ceiling,
    because a later enable must not inherit a budget nobody re-reviewed.

    Outcomes: ``200`` with the new state; ``400`` for a body that is not a JSON
    object carrying a boolean ``enabled`` (plus a string ``endpoint`` when
    enabling, and a non-negative whole ``history_budget_chars`` when present);
    ``403`` for a non-owner, and for an ENABLING write the ceiling withdrew
    (``decisions_capability_denied``); ``409`` when the echoed endpoint is not the one
    config names now; ``500`` for a corrupt keystone, which is left byte-identical
    rather than clobbered (the ``StateCorruptError`` precedent in
    ``handlers/computer_use.py``).

    """POST /api/decisions/feedback -- record one verdict about one turn.

    Body: ``{"turn_id": str, "verdict": "right"|"wrong"|null, "side": "jev"|"baseline"}``.
    ``verdict: null`` is a real value and means the person TOOK BACK an earlier
    verdict, which the log has to be able to say; ``side`` names which of the two
    answers the verdict is about and is required for every verdict, including a
    cleared one, because a row that names no side names no decision.

    Writes exactly one APPENDED row and never touches an existing one. A verdict
    is a second event about the turn, not a correction of the row that recorded
    it, so a changed mind reads as two rows with two timestamps -- which is what
    makes "when did they change their mind" answerable at all. The append goes
    through the log's own writer, off the event loop, so it inherits the pinned
    destination, the per-file size ceiling and the day-file retention sweep rather
    than re-implementing any of them
    (:mod:`kiro_crew.decisions.log`, ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``).

    Outcomes: ``200 {"ok": true}``; ``400`` for a body that is not a JSON object
    with a non-empty ``turn_id``, a PRESENT ``verdict`` key in the allowed set (or
    ``null``) and a side in the allowed set; ``403`` for a non-owner; ``503
    decisions_feedback_not_recorded`` when the append did not land. An omitted
    ``verdict`` is a ``400`` and not a retract: ``null`` is the retract, so a body
    that dropped the field would otherwise record one.

    That last one is the difference between this caller and every other writer of
    the decision log. Elsewhere a dropped row is an observation nobody promised,
    so ``log.append`` swallows it. Here the row IS the person's answer, and the
    day-file has a size ceiling that the turn's own rows share: on a busy sampled
    day the ceiling is reached by round traffic, and a ``200`` would tell the
    owner their verdict was recorded while nothing was written. So the append's
    verdict is read and reported, and the SEL row says ``denied`` for it -- a
    refusal that audits as success is the same lie one layer down.
