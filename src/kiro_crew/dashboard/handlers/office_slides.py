"""Slide images for the file panel: a deck rendered soffice -> PDF -> PNG, cached by content.

The file panel's ``.pptx`` preview extracts text (``/api/file-office-preview``);
a presentation is its layout, so the panel also needs the slides as pictures.
Nothing in the dashboard can draw a slide itself: that takes an office suite,
and the one open-source renderer with a faithful Impress import is LibreOffice
(``soffice``), a system package the product neither ships nor installs from a
browser request (the same stance ``apps/builtins/pptx_maker`` takes for its own
thumbnails). So this module renders WHEN ``soffice`` is on the gateway host and
reports honestly when it is not, and the panel degrades to the text outline.

Two endpoints:

* ``GET /api/file-office-slides?path=...`` -- the manifest. Validates the path
  through the file endpoints' shared open-and-check prefix, hashes the bytes,
  answers from the cache when the deck was rendered before, otherwise converts
  and rasterizes, then answers ``{"status": "ready", "digest", "count",
  "slides": [{"n", "width", "height"}]}``. Without ``soffice`` it answers
  ``{"status": "unavailable", "reason": "soffice_unavailable", "hint": "<per-OS
  install command>"}`` -- a normal state the panel renders, not an error.
* ``GET /api/file-office-slide?path=...&n=<k>`` -- one PNG. Re-runs the same
  path prefix (the picture is a derivative of the file, so reading it needs the
  same authorization as reading the file) and serves ``slide-<k>.png`` from the
  deck's cache directory.

Rendering pipeline. The deck's bytes are COPIED from the checked handle into a
private work directory (the child never opens the user's path: what it converts
is exactly what was measured and hashed, and the work dir is the only tree it
needs), then ``soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`` runs through the sandbox
chokepoint in ``strict`` mode with a private ``-env:UserInstallation`` profile
so concurrent conversions never contend for LibreOffice's profile lock, a hard
wall-clock timeout, and captured (never inherited) pipes. The PDF is rasterized
in-process with ``pypdfium2`` -- already a core dependency through ``pdfplumber``
-- at a fixed width, and deleted afterwards. Before any page is rasterized the
PDF's visible text goes through the same two screens the download path applies
(the context-aware credential redactor, then the exfiltration-URL redactor); a
deck either would change is not rendered at all -- a slide is a picture of that
text and cannot be redacted afterwards -- and the panel falls back to the text
outline, which is redacted per slide. The finished directory is renamed
into place atomically so a reader never sees a half-rendered deck.

Staging is PINNED. The work directory lives in the same agent-writable cache
tree, so between any two path-based steps its name could be swapped for a
link. Every write into it and every read out of it therefore goes through one
descriptor opened on the directory when it is created (``_Staging``):
descriptor-relative opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, ``O_EXCL`` on every create,
descriptor-relative unlinks, and a publish that is verified by inode after the
rename. The child gets paths (``soffice`` takes nothing else, and runs
sandboxed); the gateway itself never dereferences the staging path by name.
A platform without descriptor-relative calls (Windows) does not render at all:
the manifest answers ``unavailable``/``platform_unsupported`` and the panel shows
the text outline. A by-name fallback behind ``lstat`` checks was considered and
rejected -- it leaves a window in which a same-uid process swaps the work
directory for a junction and the cleanup deletes through it.

Cache. ``<data home>/cache/slide-previews/<sha256 of the bytes>/`` holds
``manifest.json`` plus ``slide-<n>.png``. Keyed by CONTENT, so an edited deck
re-renders and an unchanged one never does, and no path or user identity enters
the key. A per-digest lock dedupes concurrent requests for the same deck; a
size budget evicts least-recently-used decks so the cache cannot grow without
bound. Every request hashes the file it was asked about -- a per-slide fetch
included. There is deliberately no stat-keyed shortcut: a ``(size, mtime)``
key can collide for a same-size rewrite that preserves the timestamp and would
then answer the previous deck's slides; a sha256 over a deck under the size cap
costs milliseconds and cannot.

The cache is NOT a trust root. It lives under the data home, which a same-uid
agent can write, so nothing served from it may be taken on faith: a planted
``manifest.json`` beside a ``slide-1.png`` that is a symlink (or a hard link)
to a credential would otherwise turn an authenticated slide request into a
disclosure of that credential. Three properties close that class:

* the manifest is SIGNED -- an HMAC over its canonical body, keyed by a subkey
  derived from the dashboard's token-signing secret (``token_signing.key``,
  gateway-only: masked inside every agent sandbox and behind the file-tool
  fence, unlike the SEL key, which in-sandbox MCP servers must read) with a
  purpose label, the same derivation construction ``session_pid_sig``
  uses. An unsigned or mis-signed manifest is a cache miss, never an answer;
* the manifest records the sha256 of EVERY slide it covers, and a slide is
  served only when the bytes read hash to the recorded value -- so a swapped,
  linked or edited slide file is refused whatever it points at;
* every read opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and refuses anything but a regular file
  under a size cap (``_read_regular_nofollow``, the ``session_pid_sig`` shape).

Without a loadable trust root the cache is treated as absent: nothing is read
from it or written to it, and rendering is refused (``503 cache_unsigned``)
rather than performed into a store nothing can vouch for. That is the
fail-closed answer for a broken install, not a degraded mode to design for.

Everything blocking here runs off the event loop on the file endpoints' transfer
pool, like the other file-serving handlers.
