    Charges path+before+after in LAST-WRITE order, newest first, keeping content
    while the running total fits ``_MAX_TURN_SNAPSHOT_CHARS``. An entry past
    that point keeps its path and loses its content if the path fits; otherwise
    the whole entry is dropped. Retained paths are charged even when content is
    omitted. ``_last_write`` carries that order from the dedupe loop; an entry
    without it is charged in list order, so a caller
    that builds entries directly still gets newest-last semantics.

    One entry is protected from the budget: the most recent one whose content
    actually differs. A protected slot spent on an idempotent write -- a
    format-on-save whose before equals its after, which this flush deliberately
    keeps -- would drop the turn's only real diff to store a diff of nothing. The
    protected entry is kept whole and is NOT charged: the budget governs the
    other entries, so a turn that edits one large file and one small one keeps
    both diffs, and a turn always shows the diff for the change that just
    happened. The stored total is therefore bounded by the budget plus one
    entry's worst case (two per-file caps, their truncation markers and one
    path at ``_MAX_SNAPSHOT_PATH_CHARS``), as the constant's comment states.

    Per-entry metadata also costs space, so the character budget leaves the
    ROW COUNT unbounded. ``_MAX_TURN_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES`` bounds that separately:
    past it the oldest entries are dropped rather than kept as paths, so every
    field this function retains is bounded -- content and paths by the budget,
    each path by ``_MAX_SNAPSHOT_PATH_CHARS`` at admission, and their number by
    the cap.

    Returns the entries reordered so the ones that kept their content come
    first, then how many were demoted and how many dropped. The card renders only
    its first rows before a "show more" fold, so a reader who opens one turn sees
    the diffs it kept rather than a screen of notices with the real change folded
    away.
