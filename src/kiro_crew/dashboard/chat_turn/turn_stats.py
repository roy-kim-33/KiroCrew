    The token counts let the frontend ring tooltip show "used / window" in
    absolute tokens (sourced from the adapter's usage_update), so a 44%-of-200k
    reading is not misread as 44%-of-1M.

    When real per-turn token counts are unavailable the payload carries
    ``reset: True`` instead of the ``used_tokens``/``window_tokens`` pair. This
    is load-bearing, not cosmetic: the frontend keeps the percentage and the
    token counts in two independent slices (``slotContextPct`` vs
    ``slotContextTokens``), so a bare ``{slot, pct}`` frame updates the
    percentage while leaving whatever token counts the ring last stored in
    place — a headline that disagrees with the count beside it. Emitting
    ``reset`` whenever ``used`` is unknown — a fresh session before the first
    ``usage_update``, or the post-compaction / post-model-switch state where the
    provider zeroes ``used`` but keeps the window — moves the two fields
    together: the ring drops its stored counts and the meter self-corrects on
    the next turn's telemetry. Harmless when nothing is stored.

    Mirrors ``_flush_file_changes``: the meta lands on the in-memory message
    BEFORE ``_save_slot_to_history`` persists it, and reaches the live UI via
    the ``chat_done`` → ``refreshSlot`` re-fetch (no dedicated WS event).

    when available); ``credits`` is kiro-cli's per-turn ``meteringUsage`` sum;
    ``cost_usd`` is claude_code's API-reported cost. ``model`` is what served
    this turn (``read_turn_model``): a concrete id on a pinned session, or the
    bare ``"auto"`` when the turn was handed to Auto and the backend disclosed
    no id for it — Auto's per-turn choice is not on the ACP wire, so ``"auto"``
    is the whole of what can be said truthfully. ``ttft_ms`` is the turn's
    dispatch to first broadcast output latency (``_FirstVisibleClock``; queue
    wait excluded), stored so it is readable without telemetry on.
    Zero/empty fields are omitted so the frontend renders only what the
    provider actually reported.

    ``turn_boundary`` is ``len(slot.messages)`` captured at turn start: only
    messages appended DURING this turn are candidates. Without it, an
    error/refusal-only turn (which appends no assistant message) would walk
