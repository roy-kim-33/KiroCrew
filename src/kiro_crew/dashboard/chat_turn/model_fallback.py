    """The model a slot that pins nothing STARTS a session on, or ``""``.

    Resolved through :func:`resolve_effective_model` — the one resolver the
    dashboard's model chip already reads (``/api/agents/resolved-model``) — so
    the model an auto-created slot runs on is the model the chip says it will.
    Before this the chat-send path only consulted the crew's own pin
    (``bindings.model``) and left everything below it to ``get_or_create``,
    which resolves from the session manager's config SNAPSHOT — refreshed only
    by the settings handlers that call ``refresh_defaults`` — while this turn and
    the chip both read a fresh load. A global ``agent.model`` written any other
    way (``kirocrew config set``, a hand edit) was therefore shown by the chip
    but not run by the first turn of a fresh slot until the gateway restarted.

    The value is deliberately a LOCAL for the ``get_or_create`` call and is
    NEVER written to ``slot.model``. That field is persisted slot state and is
    re-sent as a ``set_model`` override on every resume, so an empty value means
    "inherit": the slot follows a later change to ``agent.model`` or to the
    agent's pin, the chip renders the inherited value live, and the explicit
    slot-create endpoint stores ``""`` when nothing is picked. Persisting the
    resolved default here would silently turn every inheriting slot into a
    permanent pin on its first message, and would route an inherited default
    the account cannot run through the "isn't offered right now" pin flow.

    Returns ``""`` when the slot or crew already pins a model (nothing to
    resolve), when the config could not be loaded, or when every tier defers
    to the backend — ``get_or_create`` then resolves on its own.

    Blocking: ``resolve_effective_model`` reaches ``_resolve_named_agent_model``
    (a glob + per-file read of the installed agent JSON) and
    ``_resolve_agent_model`` (another file read), so callers run this through
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` and never inline on the event loop. That makes the
    ``except`` below load-bearing beyond logging: ``resolve_agent_bindings``
    inside the resolver can raise ``StopIteration`` on a malformed config, and a
    ``StopIteration`` cannot be delivered through a Future (3.12+ substitutes a
    ``RuntimeError``; older interpreters leave the future PENDING and the await
    hangs), so awaiting the thread would fail with the wrong error, or not
    return at all, instead of surfacing the resolver's. ``StopIteration`` is an
    ``Exception`` subclass, so it is converted to ``""`` HERE, in the worker,
    before it can reach the Future boundary. Keep the clause at ``Exception``
    or wider; narrowing it re-opens that hole.

    Runs at the start of the first turn that is NOT the retry replay. When
    the session has moved off the candidate this feature set (explicit
    pick, session reset), the record is stale — drop it and restore nothing,
    mirroring :func:`probe_fallback_restore`'s moved-off rule. One moved-off
    case is handed over instead of dropped: an active throttle walk whose
    recorded restore target IS the candidate advanced off it mid-retry, so
    the walk's target is rewritten to this record's primary and the walk's
    own restore returns the session there. An explicit
    user pick between the retry and this restore wins — even a pick of
    exactly the fallback id, which model equality alone cannot tell apart
    from our own swap: the pick-generation snapshot taken under the pick
    lock at swap time (``_refusal_pick_gen`` vs ``_model_pick_gen``) detects
    it, and the record is dropped without touching the model. A failed or
    unwitnessed restore keeps the record so the next genuine turn tries
    again. Never raises.

    Lock order: the session-scoped switch lock, then the slot's pick lock —
    the same relative order as the switch handlers (which take
    ``slot._lock`` first; this function never touches ``slot._lock``, so no
    inversion is possible). The session lock is what closes the alias race:
    without it, a pick on a DIFFERENT slot of the same session holds only
    disjoint locks, and the epoch snapshot below is read once BEFORE the
    ``set_model`` await — a pick landing inside that await would be applied
    first and then silently overwritten when the restore's ``set_model``
    completes last. Holding the session lock across the whole
    check-and-restore makes the two switches strictly ordered: a pick either
    completes first (the epoch check drops the record) or starts after the
    restore finishes (the pick wins by ordering, as an explicit choice
    should).
