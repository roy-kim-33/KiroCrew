def _session_principal(session_key: str) -> str:
    """The platform user id a DIRECT session key names, or ``""``.

    The persisted ``ChannelLink`` records a conversation, and a conversation id is
    what made a revoked recipient unanswerable for the transports whose conversation
    id is not their user id. The session KEY carries the peer: the canonical grammar is
    ``{surface}:{agent}:{chat_type}:{scope…}`` and for a 1:1 DM the scope is exactly
    the peer's platform id. Parsing goes through ``messaging.link.parse_session_key``
    because that module is the ONE canonical address parser (RFC §9 rule 4); a second
    decomposition here would drift from the grammar the keys are built with.

    Derived from the KEY ALONE, deliberately. Two other records name a peer and
    neither is safe here, because a principal is only usable if it describes the
    conversation the link points at:

    * the session's stored channel value (``{namespace}:{user_id}``) is written ONCE,
      when the session is created, while the origin/mirror link is rewritten on
      later turns. Under a ``unified`` bucket -- which collapses several peers' 1:1
      DMs into one session on purpose -- the two therefore drift: the attribution can
      name the peer who created the session while the link points at a different
      peer's conversation. Authorizing against it would check the wrong person and
      pass, which is worse than declining to name one.
    * a **forum or group** scope is ``(chat_id, thread_id)``, so its audience is a
      room and no single principal owns it. Returning ``scope[0]`` would hand a
      supergroup id to a check that tests USER rosters.

    Empty therefore means "the key does not name one principal", never "no principal
    is authorized". A transport whose other rosters can still judge the route (a
    Discord thread against its thread allow-list) uses them; one with nothing left to
    consult refuses, because this feeds a network egress boundary.

    A third source IS consulted, but by the ladder rather than here, and only when
    this returns ``""``: the peer the mirror link recorded when the GATEWAY admitted
    it (``ChannelLink.principal``), under a MAC the gateway alone can mint over the
    session key and the whole location (``ChannelLink.admission``, see
    :func:`_recipient_principal`). That record is free of the drift above because
    it is written in the same write as the conversation id it describes and signed
    together with it, so a row rewritten, moved or unsigned by anything but the
    gateway fails to verify; the transport's own record of the conversation
    (``MessagingTransport.direct_peer_of``) must agree with it whenever the
    transport has one. That is what serves a dashboard-born session mirrored to a
    Discord DM, whose key names nobody and whose DM channel id cannot be tested
    against a user roster.

      session map is writable by in-sandbox code, so without it a row rewritten to
      name an allow-listed user for a revoked user's DM, or to aim one session's
      replies at another allow-listed user's DM, would be authorized against the
      wrong person and pass. A row with no admission, one that does not verify, and
      one signed under a rotated key are refused, audited, and logged once, and the
      remedy is named: re-link the session, which mints a fresh record;
    * the transport's own record of the conversation, when it has one, AGREES
      (:func:`_attested_peer`, defense in depth): a pairing the client learned on its

      contradicts nothing, so the verified record stands and this leg admits the

      that ladder's waits before the pairing is re-learned is still refused there;
      a send that never waits is delivered.)
