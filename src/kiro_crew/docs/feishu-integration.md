# Feishu Integration

Talk to your Kiro Crew agent from Feishu (Lark / 飞书) — through a Feishu custom
app bot. Create the app in the Feishu developer console, drop in two values, and
you're chatting.

Like Telegram and WeCom, the connection is outbound-only: Kiro Crew opens a
long-connection WebSocket to Feishu, so there's no callback URL, public
hostname, or open port to manage.

> **Optional dependency.** The Feishu long connection is the one channel that is
> only specified through a vendor SDK (handshake, tenant-token refresh, and
> frame envelope), so it needs `lark-oapi`. It is **not** part of core:
> `pip install "kirocrew[feishu]"`. Without it the gateway logs a line and skips
> the channel — nothing else is affected.

## Quick start

You'll need a running gateway (`kirocrew gateway`), `lark-oapi` installed, and
access to <https://open.feishu.cn/app> (or <https://open.larksuite.com/app> for
Lark).

1. **Create a custom app** — in the developer console, create an app and note
   its **App ID** and **App Secret** from *Credentials & Basic Info*.
2. **Add the bot capability** — *Add features → Bot*.
3. **Grant permissions** — under *Permissions & Scopes*, add
   `im:message` (receive) and `im:message:send_as_bot` (reply).
4. **Use long connection** — under *Events & Callbacks*, choose
   **Long connection** (not a request URL), then subscribe to
   `im.message.receive_v1`.
5. **Publish the app** so your tenant can install it.
6. **Find your open_id** — the console's API Explorer, or any inbound message
   in the gateway log, shows the sender's `open_id` (it starts with `ou_`).
7. **Save the credentials** to `~/.kiro/crew/.env`:
   ```
   FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxxxxxxxxxxx
   FEISHU_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
   ```
8. **Turn it on** in `~/.kiro/crew/config.json`:
   ```json
   "feishu": {
     "enabled": true,
     "allowed_open_ids": ["ou_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]
   }
   ```
9. **Restart:**
   ```bash
   kirocrew restart
   ```

DM the bot in Feishu and it answers. If it stays quiet, look for
`Feishu WebSocket receiver started` in the gateway log and confirm your
`open_id` is in `allowed_open_ids`.

## Who can reach it

Deny-by-default, in both directions:

- **`allowed_open_ids` is the allow-list.** An empty list authorises **nobody** —
  the bot stays reachable on the Feishu side but rejects every message. This is
  deliberate: publishing an app must never mean an open door.
- **Group chats need two switches.** A group message is served only when
  `allow_group` is `true` **and** the group's `chat_id` is in
  `allowed_group_ids`. Either one alone denies.
- **A group has its own conversation.** A group turn is keyed by the group's
  `chat_id` under a non-direct chat type, so an allow-listed user writing in a
  group never resumes their private DM session — their DM history cannot become
  context for a reply the whole room reads. This holds under
  `messaging.dm_scope: unified` too, where a DM key deliberately collapses into
  a cross-channel bucket and a group key deliberately does not.
- **Only two chat types are served.** A DM (`p2p`) and a group (`group`) are
  named explicitly; a message whose chat type is absent or unrecognised is
  denied rather than assumed to be a DM, so a context whose authorisation was
  never evaluated can never run a turn.
- **Every denial is audited.** Rejected inbound messages write a SEL audit
  record with `source: feishu`, so an unexpected sender shows up in
  `kirocrew security posture` rather than vanishing.
- Feishu itself only delivers a group message to the bot when it is
  **@-mentioned**, so a bot in a busy group does not see unrelated chatter.
- **Mentions reach the agent as names.** Feishu puts opaque placeholders
  (`@_user_1`) in the message text and the display names in a separate
  `mentions` list, so the two are rejoined before the agent sees the prompt:
  "ask @Alice to review" stays intact rather than becoming "ask to review".
  `@_all` becomes `@all`. A message that is nothing but mentions carries no
  instruction and is ignored, so a bare `@bot` does not start an empty turn.
- **Slash commands work in a group too.** A group message has to mention the
  bot, so it arrives as `@FeishuBot /new`. That single leading mention is
  removed before matching, so `/new`, `/reset` and `/compact` still intercept
  there instead of being sent to the agent as a prompt.
  Only a bare command intercepts, and **a message naming anyone else is never a
  command**: `@FeishuBot please run /new later` and `@FeishuBot /new @Alice` are
  both ordinary prompts. That second case is deliberate — reading it as `/new`
  would reset the conversation on a message you addressed to a colleague, and
  that is not recoverable, so anything ambiguous is treated as a prompt.

## Settings

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feishu.enabled` | `false` | Top-level switch. Also needs both env vars. |
| `feishu.allowed_open_ids` | `[]` | Who may DM the bot. Empty = nobody. |
| `feishu.allow_group` | `false` | Serve group chats at all. |
| `feishu.allowed_group_ids` | `[]` | Which groups, when `allow_group` is on. |
| `feishu.soft_threshold_pct` | `80` | Context % that prompts you to `/compact` or `/new`. |
| `feishu.hard_threshold_pct` | `95` | Context % that forces a compaction. |

Credentials come from the environment only (`FEISHU_APP_ID`,
`FEISHU_APP_SECRET`), matching the console's own naming — they are never written
into `config.json`.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/new` (or `/reset`) | Start a fresh session; the old context is dropped. |
| `/compact` | Compact the current context in place. |

Anything else is a prompt.

## What this channel can and cannot do

Feishu v1 is deliberately single-shot: the agent's answer is buffered and sent
as **one reply** when the turn completes, rather than streamed. There are no
interactive buttons, so when the agent offers a choice, the `[OPTIONS: …]`
trailer arrives as a numbered list and you answer by typing one — which is an
ordinary message, so nothing extra has to be configured.

Known gaps, all follow-up work rather than defects:

- **No streaming.** Feishu supports `PATCH /im/v1/messages/{id}`, so
  edit-in-place streaming is a natural next step.
- **Text only.** Non-text messages (images, files, audio) are ignored inbound.
- **Replies only.** The bot answers an inbound message and cannot start a
  conversation, so it is not a proactive-notification target.
- **No dashboard Settings panel yet.** Configure it in `config.json`; the other
  channels' Settings pages are the model for the panel to come.
- **No auto-reconnect beyond the SDK's own.** `lark-oapi` reconnects
  internally; if it gives up, the gateway logs that the receiver is down and you
  restart.

## How it fits together

The channel is a thin transport over the shared messaging core — the same
`TurnDriver` (credential redaction, tool-approval ladder, SEL audit) every other
channel uses. See [messaging-transport.md](messaging-transport.md).

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `feishu/client.py` | `lark-oapi` WebSocket receive + REST reply |
| `feishu/transport.py` | Authorisation (deny-by-default) and normalisation |
| `feishu/renderer.py` | Buffers the turn, sends one reply |
| `feishu/transport_dispatch.py` | Drives `TurnDriver`, handles `/new` `/compact` |
| `feishu/gateway.py` | `maybe_start_feishu()` boot entry point |
