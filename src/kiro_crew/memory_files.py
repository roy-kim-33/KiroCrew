"""Local-disk file access for the markdown memory layer.

This module holds :class:`LocalMemoryFiles`, the public edition's implementation
of the ``MemoryFiles`` extension point: the admission gates, the hardened reader
and the atomic writer behind the ``MemoryStore`` markdown surface. Each gate
runs the same syscalls in the same order, returns the same refusal messages and
writes the same SEL audit records the direct ``MemoryStore`` reads and writes
rely on, so the public edition's behaviour, including its failure modes, is
fixed by this one implementation.

It lives in its own module rather than in ``platform/defaults.py`` because these
gates need ``hooks``, ``pinned_fs``, ``platform_compat`` and ``memory_startup``;
importing that set into the platform contract would make the cheap-to-import
defaults module drag in most of the memory stack, and the code reads better next
to the caller it was extracted from than inside a file of one-line no-op
adapters.

## What an alternative implementation does and does not owe

The guarantees here are LOCAL-INODE guarantees: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` opens, rejection
of symlinks, hardlinks, FIFOs and devices, a ``realpath`` containment check, and
a double-stat retry so reported metadata always describes the bytes returned.
They exist because the memory directory is agent-writable, and an agent that can
plant a symlink there could otherwise make a memory read republish an arbitrary
file the user can read.

An implementation backed by something that has no inodes has no such attack to
defend against, and must not pretend to run these checks. What it DOES owe is
every guarantee stated in the protocol and relied on by callers: an unreadable
or oversized source is an empty entry rather than partial text, content is valid
UTF-8 or refused, reported metadata matches the bytes returned, and a write
refused for drift returns ``False`` without retrying against a newer base.

        through :func:`kiro_crew.hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink` confined

        files (so a ``/dev/zero`` target cannot wedge the read), rejects
        hardlinked inodes and sensitive resolved targets, and caps the size.
        A refused, unreadable, oversized, or undecodable file surfaces as an
        empty entry — same shape as a missing file — never as leaked content

        concurrent consolidation rewrites or prunes the file mid-read, the
