    The parsed spec is returned rather than its path, and the caller uses it
    as it stands. Handing back a path to reopen would put a second read outside
    the guards: between the reader resolving a symlink and the reopen, the link
    can be repointed at a sensitive file, which would then be read with no
    denial and no SEL audit entry.

    Raises :class:`AmbiguousAgentSpecError` when two specs declare *agent_id*,
    the refusal :func:`kiro_crew.agent.agent_spec_path` makes on the same

    Only the first matching spec is held; a later match keeps its path and its
    parse is dropped at once. The reader caps each file, so the parsed-spec
    memory this scan holds at its peak is one capped parse, not one per
    same-name file; the paths themselves, one per candidate, are what the
    refusal message needs and are all the scan keeps of the rest.

    This is a fresh walk rather than a filter over :func:`parsed_agent_specs`,
    and the difference is the labels, not the loop. That cache serves catalog
    readers of one directory, so its SEL labels are first-reader-wins for the
    life of a snapshot; a denial met here would then be attributed to whichever
    listing warmed the cache instead of to the projection or the policy read
    that asked, which is the attribution the call-site ratchet exists to keep.
    The cache also hands out its own rows to be treated as read-only, where

    """Agent config files declared by a project checkout, sorted by stem.

    Returns the kiro-cli-native ``<project>/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and the markdown
    ``*.md`` form beside it — the only project location the backends resolve
    ``--agent`` against, and therefore the only one whose names are dispatchable.
    Dispatchable by the kiro-cli backend, which reads the checkout itself: the
    KAS projection (:func:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_agents.load_agent_spec`) reads the
    user-level directory only, for either form, so a project-only agent selected
    on a KAS session is refused at session start there. Whether a checkout's
    spec may be projected at all is a governance question (a checkout can
    shadow a managed agent), not a question of which form is scanned, and the
    two forms are treated alike here.

    *include_legacy* additionally returns ``<project>/.kiro/*.agent-spec.json``, Kiro
    Crew's own older convention. It defaults to ``False`` because every dispatch
    surface (the agent picker, ``spawn_run`` validation, per-turn resolution) must
    offer only agents the backend can actually activate; a legacy-only name would be
    accepted here and then fail at ``session/set_mode``. Slack passes ``True`` to
    keep its pre-existing listing and resolution behavior.

    Returns ``[]`` for a falsy or sensitive *project_dir*, and never raises: an
    unreadable checkout yields no agents rather than failing the caller's scan.

    The sensitive-path check is on the project root because that value arrives from
    a caller-supplied session field; the per-file resolved-target check that
    catches a planted symlink stays with the reader (:func:`_read_agent_spec`).

    WHICH spec is live is answered by :func:`list_agents`, not re-decided here.
    That roster is what the agent picker shows and what the backend activates, so

    duplicate name, and last-seen winning among duplicate project specs. Reading
    the winner instead of reproducing the rules is what keeps the two from
    drifting; a second copy of the precedence, however well tested, is a copy
    that can disagree.

    Only the winning file is then parsed, through the same hardened reader under
    this function's own *operation* label, so a denial is attributed to the hint
    rather than to a listing. That read applies the full guard set again (size
    cap, sidecars, sensitive symlink targets, non-object JSON), so reopening by
    name is not an unguarded second read.

    Best-effort and never raises: an unknown agent, an unreadable or oversized
