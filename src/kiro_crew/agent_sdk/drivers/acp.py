"""The ACP driver's half of the machine-local install question.

The layer above (:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install`) owns the *contract*
-- three states, which component a remedy names, how long a verdict is reused.
This module owns the one thing that contract cannot express without reaching
into the harness: whether a spawn of that harness would actually **resolve**
right now.

**It asks through the spawn's own resolvers, never a reimplementation.** A probe
that hand-rolled a PATH search would agree with the spawn only by coincidence:
the resolvers here consult an env override, a project-local ``node_modules``,
mise, and an augmented PATH that includes shims a bare ``shutil.which`` cannot
see. A second search would tell the operator they are ready and then fail the
session, which is a worse outcome than saying nothing.

Every function returns plain data -- a bool, a string, a tuple of bools -- so no
ACP type crosses the boundary. Two consequences are deliberate rather than
incidental:

* **A resolver that raises is left to raise.** The failed-CHECK verdict belongs
  to the caller's three-state contract, and swallowing the exception here would
  hand it a ``False`` indistinguishable from an honest "absent" -- which is
  exactly the collapse of ``unknown`` into ``missing`` that contract forbids.
* **The paths themselves are dropped.** Nothing above needs the resolved
  location, and a returned path is a filesystem detail the SDK would then be
  tempted to interpret.

Imports of ``kiro_crew.acp`` are FUNCTION-LOCAL throughout.
``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` pulls in the ACP client and the runtime, and this
module is reached from a dashboard handler on the boot path, so a module-scope
import would drag both into gateway start. It also keeps the lookup at CALL
time, in the resolvers' own defining module -- which is what lets a test patch
the spawn's resolver and have the probe actually see it.

    disagree with what a spawn will actually do, and the dangerous direction is
    exactly the one an operator walks into: a failed Claude session caches
    ``None``, they install the adapter the panel told them to install, and a fresh
    probe would report ``installed`` while every subsequent spawn still reuses the
    cached ``None`` and dies with ``AcpError``.

    So the cache is consulted, not bypassed. Reading it rather than INVALIDATING
    it is deliberate: invalidation would make a dashboard GET mutate a global on
    the spawn path, and the honest disclosure ("installed, restart to use it")
    costs the operator one restart while never promising something that then
    fails.
