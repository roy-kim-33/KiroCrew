"""The session tree -- which session opened which, folded across every session log.

:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.projection` folds ONE log and reads nothing else (RFC
FR-4). This module is the one reader that looks across logs, and it is a
different kind of thing on purpose. A ``session_create`` child records its
creator on its own ``session/opened`` entry (``parent {slot, sid?}``: the child
knows its creator at its first turn, the creator never learns the child's id),
so the tree of sessions is not a fold over any one log but over the FIRST entry
of all of them, keyed by slot. dsh does the same with its ``parentSession``
header field and a read-side ``flattenLineage``: the record lives on the child,
the tree is a pure function over the collection, and an orphan or a cycle
degrades to root rather than to an error.

Two pieces, kept apart so each is testable on its own:

* :func:`fold_tree` -- pure. :class:`OpenedRecord` in, one :class:`TreeNode`
  per slot out.
* :class:`SessionTree` -- the scanner. It reads the header and the first entry
  of every session log's oldest surviving segment and keeps that head cached
  per unit, for at most :data:`TREE_UNIT_CAP` units per scan. The store never
  rewrites a written line, so the two lines a scan reads are immutable for as
  long as the segment exists; the cache therefore needs no mtime and is dropped
  only when the segment is gone (retention, removal) or the file was replaced
  (a new inode under the same name, or a shorter file under a recycled one).

Only the first entry is read, and that is enough. The emitter writes ``parent``
from a process-local mint witness that exists before the child's first turn or
never, so the entry that CREATED the log carries the parent whenever any entry
does, and a later re-attach in the same process can only repeat it. The fold
still applies the wider rule -- the parent is taken from ANY record of a slot
that carries one, and a record without one never retracts it -- so a slot whose
later logs were opened after a gateway restart (witness gone, no ``parent``)
folds to the parent its first log recorded.

The tree is keyed by SLOT. ``parent.sid`` on the entry is the creator's ACP
session id at the moment of creation -- an audit citation for a reader of the
logs themselves, not a tree key: a slot outlives its ACP session, and the live
row a child nests under is the slot's. This reader does not read it.
