"""Eager folding: an EAGER fold is advanced when its entry lands, not when it is read.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A slot-keyed fold is answered by walking every line of every unit the
slot ran under, because the fold interprets one entry type and the file is mostly
message bodies (:func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.fold_slot_warm` says this at
length). The warm memo removed the repeat of that walk, but never the first one, and a
dashboard reading the work board on a timer pays it on every cold cell. The value it
wants is a function of entries this process has just written, so it can be folded then
-- and the read becomes a memo lookup.

WHAT IS ON THE APPEND PATH. One :meth:`queue.Queue.put_nowait`. Not the slot lookup,
not the fold, not the frame: those are the worker's, because each of them reads a file
or builds a value and the thread that just committed an entry is either the event loop
or the one writer thread every session's appends are serialized through. A full queue
DROPS and counts (:func:`eager_dropped`) rather than waiting, for the reason the
emitter gives about its own buffer: a slow consumer must cost currency, never turn
latency. Dropping is safe because the fold is not the record -- the log is -- so a
dropped wake leaves the memo behind the file and the next READ carries it forward,
which is exactly the lazy behaviour that was there before.

WHAT THE WORKER RUNS. :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.read_slot_projection`, the
same call the dashboard route makes. Not a second folding path: the rules a slot fold
has to enforce about continuing a cell -- a changed unit list, a recreated unit, an
earlier unit that grew, a rewritten prefix -- are stated once over there, and a rule
missing from a copy here would be a wrong record rather than a slow one. It also
resolves the unit list through the fold's OWNER, which is what makes the value the
eager path stores equal to the one a reader would have folded.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: push. An advanced fold is not broadcast, and that is a decision
rather than an omission. A slot fold's ``last_seq`` is the NEWEST unit's own seq by
contract, and conductor units are folded before worker units -- so a conductor-side change
on a board with any worker bound leaves that number unmoved, and any client rule that
orders frames by it would discard the changed value. Pushing correctly needs a monotonic
per-(slot, fold) revision that reads and frames share, which is a new contract in the read
path; and there is no consumer yet to need it. So the value is folded here and READ from
here, and the revision question belongs to the change that adds the reader.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Durable. The memo lives in this process, so a restart folds cold; a
savepoint for a SLOT fold would be a store of its own, keyed by slot rather than by
unit, with its own admission rules about the unit vector it was folded over. That is
not this module's, and :func:`~kiro_crew.session_ledger._fold_checkpoint` already says
so about the same cell.

    1`` on the orphaned old queue while incrementing the NEW test's counter. That count
    settles against a queue no worker drains, so a later ``drain`` never reaches parity.

    """Drain what the writer owes, stop this worker, and FENCE the gap after it.

    Three steps, and the third is the one that makes the other two enough.

    Draining first means the appends already owed are folded while the caller's data home
    is still pinned. Best-effort by design: a test whose SUBJECT is a writer that cannot
    write leaves entries owed forever, so a required drain would fail exactly those tests
    for doing their job.

    Stopping second leaves no daemon running.

    And the fence closes what draining cannot. A late append lands on the writer thread
    after this returns, calls :func:`note_commit`, and :func:`_ensure_worker` would answer
    it by clearing the stop flag and starting a replacement daemon -- which resolves the
    data home when it folds, by then whatever the environment names. So this sets a latch
    and :func:`note_commit` drops wakes while it holds: between one caller's teardown and
    the next one's setup, a wake is a leak rather than a request.
    :func:`resume_for_tests` lifts it, which is what a test framework calls before handing
    control to a test, so every test still runs against a live worker.

    RETURNED rather than raised: the caller is a teardown floor that must finish its own
    work before reporting. :func:`stop_for_tests` raises for a test that calls it directly.

    ``emit`` is imported inside the call, not at module scope, because the append path
    imports THIS module and this one is the boot-path gate's own example.
    """
    # boot-path import gate, and a cycle: ``emit`` imports THIS module to reach
    # ``note_commit``, so a module-scope import here would both close that loop and put
    # the append path's dependencies on the gateway's boot path.
    from kiro_crew.crew_log import emit

    emit.flush()
    # Fence BEFORE the stop, not after it. The drain above enqueues the wakes already
    # owed while the home is still pinned; once it returns, every FURTHER wake is a leak.
    # Setting the latch here -- rather than in a ``finally`` after ``stop_for_tests``
    # returns -- closes the window the stop itself opens: ``flush``'s 5s wait is bounded
    # and its result discarded, so the emit writer can still be live, and a wake it lands
    # during the join-then-reset would otherwise pass ``note_commit`` and reach
    # ``_ensure_worker``, which would clear ``_stopping`` and start a replacement daemon
    # that the reset then orphans -- and that orphan resolves the data home once the pin
    # lifts. With the latch already set, ``note_commit`` drops it and ``_ensure_worker``
    # refuses to (re)start, so nothing survives the stop.

    A test seam, named as one. The worker is a process-wide daemon holding a queue, so a
    test that leaves it running lets one case's wake land inside the next case's data
    home -- and a counter carried between cases makes a drop count meaningless.

    A join that expires RAISES, because the worker resolves the data home when it folds
    and a case's home is an env pin its teardown lifts: a batch outliving this call writes
    into whatever home the environment names once that pin is gone, and this call is the
    last moment at which such a write is attributable to the case that queued it.
    ``drain_breadcrumb_writes`` in ``test/conftest.py`` raises for the same reason.

    THE ORDER IS THE CONTRACT, and it is three steps that each own one thing: ask the
    worker to stop and wait for it; give up loudly while CHANGING NOTHING if it will not;
    reset only once it is confirmed dead. A live worker is still reading ``_queue`` and
    still counting, and it is still the only thing a later stop could join -- so the
    expiry path keeps the handle, the queue and the counters exactly as the worker left
    them, and the caller either retries or reports. Resetting under a live worker, or
    dropping its handle, is how a stop becomes the thing that strands a thread.
