"""A small in-process event bus for crew-log events, and the events themselves.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The eager folder produces a value several consumers want -- a socket
exporter now, a summary fold and a card trigger later -- and it must know about none of
them. Calling a dashboard broadcaster from :mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.eager` would import
the dashboard from inside the crew log, which closes a cycle (the dashboard imports the
append path) and puts a consumer's name in the producer's code. A subscription registered
AT the consumer inverts that: the crew log publishes, and whoever cares subscribes.

WHAT IT IS NOT. A queue, a thread, or a delivery guarantee.

Fan-out is SYNCHRONOUS and on the publisher's own thread, which is the eager fold worker
-- never the append path, which still pays one ``queue.put_nowait`` and nothing else. So
a subscriber owes the same contract the emitter's growth listener owes: do no real work
here, hand it to your own loop. One that blocks blocks the folder.

Subscribers can be KEYED by (scope, key, fold), so a publish walks only the ones that
can match, and each subscription returns a DISPOSER that removes it. A subscriber that
joins late can ask for a BASELINE: the current value of its one cell, read through the
projection read path on the subscriber's own thread, followed only by pushed events with
a higher revision. See :func:`subscribe`.

A subscriber that RAISES is logged and the others still run, because a bus whose
first subscriber can silence the rest is a bus that makes every consumer depend on every
other one's bugs.

And nothing is retained: an event published with no subscriber is dropped, with no replay
and no backlog. A baseline is a fresh READ of the fold, not a replay from the bus. That is safe for the same reason a dropped eager wake is safe -- the fold
is not the record, the log is -- so a lost event leaves a consumer behind the file and the
next read carries it forward.

WHO SUBSCRIBES. One subscriber object today, registered where the dashboard state
exists (``install_crew_log_publisher``): the WS exporter turns a :class:`FoldAdvanced`
into a ``slot_projection`` or ``session_projection`` frame, and a :class:`TreeAdvanced`
into one coalesced ``slot_patch`` of the rows whose ``parent`` moved. Three more are
named and NOT built: a summary fold over a session's events, the automatic-card
sentence trigger, and channel
notifications. They are named here because the shape of this module is the answer to
"where does the next consumer go", and a reader asking that should not have to guess.

class FoldAdvanced(NamedTuple):
    """One fold advanced to a new value, as the eager folder saw it.

    ``scope`` says what ``key`` names: ``"slot"`` for a slot-keyed fold (a board joined
    across every unit the slot ran under) and ``"session"`` for a session-keyed one (one
    unit's file, ``key`` being that unit's id). One event type for both, because a
    consumer's rule is the same for both -- keep the highest revision per
    (scope, key, fold) -- and the two revisions come from one counter.

    Published once per COALESCED BATCH per (key, fold), not once per entry: the folder
    drains its whole queue and folds each affected cell once, and this rides that. A turn
    that writes six entries therefore produces one event per fold it moved.

    ``revision`` is what ORDERS two of these for the same (key, fold), and ``seq`` is
    not. A slot fold's seq is the newest unit's own by contract, so a conductor-side
    change on a board with any worker bound leaves it unmoved, and adding a unit can move
    the value while moving the seq DOWN; a session fold's seq restarts when its unit is
    recreated under the same id. The revision is minted by the process that folded and
    never read off a file, so it rises across all of those alike. ``seq`` is carried
    anyway because it is what a reader truncates a crew-log read against.

    ``value`` is the RENDERED projection, not the fold state. A subscriber is a reader,
    and handing it the state would hand it the object the memo is still folding.

    the INDEX, not a predicate: :func:`publish` looks up only the buckets an event can
    match, so a subscriber keyed to one board costs a publish about another board
    nothing. A subscription with no filter receives every event of *kind*, which is what
    the dashboard's WS exporter uses. Events without those attributes (any kind other
    than :data:`FOLD_ADVANCED`) reach only unfiltered subscribers.

    THE DISPOSER removes the subscription. Calling it twice is a no-op, and calling it
    from inside the callback is safe: a publish already in progress does not call a

    BASELINE. With ``baseline=True`` (which needs *scope*, *key* and *fold* all set, and
    *kind* :data:`FOLD_ADVANCED`) the subscriber is first handed the CURRENT value of its
    one (scope, key, fold) as a :class:`FoldAdvanced`, read through the projection read

    join race: the subscription is registered BEFORE the read, events that arrive during

    baseline and the floor stays at 0.

    The baseline read is FILE I/O on the CALLER's thread. That keeps it off the append

    is removed and the exception propagates, so a caller never holds a disposer for a
