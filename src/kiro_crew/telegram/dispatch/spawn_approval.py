    """Post a spawn-approval prompt to the ORIGINATING Telegram conversation.

    Registered into the channel-neutral
    :mod:`~kiro_crew.messaging.spawn_approval_delivery` seam so the single
    host spawn gate can reach the same Approve/Deny/Trust keyboard the
    main-agent tool ladder already uses here. Returns the user's decision
    (``True``/``False``), or ``None`` to tell the gate "not surfaced here,
    fall through to Slack/dashboard" — for a key this dispatcher cannot turn
    back into a chat (``unified`` dm_scope drops the peer, a non-``telegram``
    key, an unparseable one), when the client is not up, when the
    destination's authorization has since been withdrawn, or when the post
    fails. The operator's ``channels`` governance ceiling is read TWICE for
    one prompt, and both reads belong to the seam: before it invokes any hook,
    so a denied channel is never prompted at all, and again through
    ``unpressed_wait_answer`` when a wait elapses unpressed, because a deny
    can land inside that wait. This method owns neither reading; it asks for
    the second one.

    The wait is the SAME deny-by-default one a tool prompt uses
    (:class:`TelegramApprovalDecider`, ``APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S``): the press
    resolves through the ``on_callback`` ``a:`` branch exactly as a tool
    approval does, so Trust still runs ``add_trusted_session`` and a spawn id
    (``spawn:<agent_id>``) cannot collide with an opaque tool id in the
    registry keyed by ``session_key:request_id``.

    The prompt is armed under ``parent_session_key`` VERBATIM (its ``:genN``
    suffix included), but a press recomputes the key from the LIVE
    conversation (``_callback_session_key``). A generation rotation between the
    spawn and the press — ``/new``, an idle reset, a daily rotation — bumps the
    generation, so the recomputed key does not match the armed one, the press
    resolves nothing, and the prompt deny-by-defaults at the timeout (the user
    sees "already expired"). This mirrors how a mid-run tool prompt behaves
    across a rotation, and it stays a DENY: a rotation is the conversation
    moving on, not a withdrawal of the right to answer. An elapsed wait is a
    fall-through in one case only, when AUTHORIZATION ended during it -- the
    prompt was surfaced, so otherwise ``False`` is a real decision and the gate
    refuses the spawn on it. Two authorities can end authorization mid-wait and
    both are re-read when the wait elapses: this conversation's own
    authorization, which ``on_callback`` checks first for every press with no
    exemption (``_spawn_prompt_destination_permitted``, the same pair consulted
    before posting), and the operator's ``channels`` ceiling, whose reading
    belongs to the seam (``unpressed_wait_answer``) for every channel.
