"""The handlers behind Telegram's chat commands.

``TelegramDispatcher.handle_message`` parses a command and dispatches it through
``self``; the handlers here implement ``/kirocrew dashboard``, ``/yolo``, ``/cron``,
``/spawn``, ``/task``, ``/link``, ``/unlink`` and ``/compact``, the direct-message gate
for host-wide listings, and markdown replies. The channel-neutral half of each
command lives in ``messaging/commands.py`` and ``messaging/link.py``. ``/stop`` and
``/title`` stay in ``transport_dispatch.py``, where repository guards read them, and
the bare privacy modifiers stay inline in ``handle_message``; ``/model`` and
``/agent`` are ``dispatch/pickers.py`` and ``/voice`` is ``dispatch/voice.py``.

    names state belonging to the host rather than to this conversation -- every
    session on the box, every scheduled job -- would disclose it to members who

    But the same command changes scope with its argument, which the command name
    does not show: `/spawn list` renders every subagent on the box with its task

    (`messaging/commands.py`) is the answer to that, held next to the functions
