"""Wire format for the append-only ledger: the header, the entry, the rules.

One ledger is one file. Line 1 is a **header** describing the unit the file
belongs to; every later line is an **entry**. Nothing is ever rewritten, so the
format has to be readable by a consumer newer *or* older than the writer:

- Unknown envelope keys are ignored rather than rejected, and an unparseable
  interior line is skipped rather than failing the read (see
  :mod:`kiro_crew.ledger.store`). ``version`` is the escape hatch for a future
  incompatible break, not a per-change workflow.
- An unknown TYPE is a different question from an unknown key, and the writer
  answers it per entry. ``ignorable: true`` says a reader may skip this line
  when it does not know the type; absent, an unknown type stops reconstruction,
  because a required entry a reader cannot interpret may change the meaning of
  everything after it. Skipping keys loses a detail, skipping a line can lose
  the plot.
- The envelope is field-compatible with the lifecycle event envelope in
  ``events/base.py``: this
  module's ``type`` is that one's ``kind``, and this module's ``time`` is its
  ``ts_ms``. Same ``domain/action`` naming, same epoch-millisecond clock, so a
  later projection can fold both streams on one axis. What this format adds is
  a writer-assigned ``seq`` (contiguous per file, which the lifecycle envelope
  deliberately left unspecified), a ``thread`` grouping key, and a ``ref``
  pointer into another file.

Two rules decide whether an entry may be written at all, and they are separate
because they answer different questions.

**Ownership** (rule 1) answers *does this kind of unit have such events at
all*: a session has turns and tool calls, a crew has members and patrols. It is
a prefix registry, :data:`TYPE_OWNERSHIP`, so adding an action to an existing
domain needs no change here.

**Namespacing** (rule 2) answers *may this emitter write this*. A crew or an app
writing into a crew ledger is a GUEST: it may write only under its own
``crew:<name>/`` or ``app:<name>/`` prefix, and only into a crew ledger. The
guest prefix is what makes the registry safe to keep short -- a guest never
needs a registry entry, because its own name is its permission. Guest types are
therefore checked by rule 2 *instead of* rule 1, not in addition to it.

Caps refuse; they never truncate. An entry over :data:`MAX_ENTRY_BYTES`, or a
``ref`` spanning more than :data:`MAX_REF_SPAN` lines, is refused whole. A
silently clipped record the caller believes landed intact is a loss the caller
cannot detect.
