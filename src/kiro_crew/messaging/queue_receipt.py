"""Mid-turn queue receipts — the single collapsing "⏳ Queued (N): …" bubble.

A message that arrives while a turn is running is either folded into that turn
as a steer or queued for after it. Queued messages get ONE receipt bubble that
is edited in place as the burst grows, then flipped to a durable record when the
turn drains it ("▶️ Now answering") or cancelled ("🛑 Cancelled"). Two channels
grew the same subsystem independently -- Telegram and Discord, ~560 duplicated
lines -- and this module is the half of it that is genuinely channel-neutral.

What lives here and what does NOT:

* HERE -- the receipt registry, its lock, and the three lifecycle transitions
  (create/grow, flip-to-answering, finalize-cancelled). These are pure
  bookkeeping over an opaque message id, and every line of them was identical
  across the two channels apart from the address type and the send call.
* NOT here -- ``_handle_busy`` and ``_drain_queue``. They re-enter the channel's
  own ``handle_message`` (whose signature differs per channel: route/chat_id/
  thread vs user_id/channel_id/thread_id) and they own the ``_active_renderers``
  registry. Sharing them would need a ``run_turn`` callback that buys nothing
  and couples this module to turn execution.

Channels reach the transitions through :class:`ReceiptSurface`, whose address is
bound at CONSTRUCTION -- so nothing below ever sees a ``chat_id``, a ``thread``
or a ``channel_id``, which is what let the five address-shaped divergences
between the two copies collapse to zero.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), matching
``messaging/dispatch.py``.

    already separates never meet in an entry, so a key that cannot tell them apart
    costs nothing there.

    That is why two channels with the same shape answer differently. A Telegram
    forum route carries the Topic in the session key, so two Topics hold separate
    entries and ``chat_id`` alone is enough. A Webex group space routes as
    ``space:{room_id}``, so two THREADS of one room share an entry and the thread
    belongs in the key beside the room.

    Every part comes from the provider's own inbound payload, so the key names a
    conversation the provider assigned and nothing the agent can choose.

    ``msg_id`` is deliberately opaque (``Any``): Telegram message ids are ints
    and Discord's are strings, the two are never interleaved in one process, and
    a generic parameter would add ceremony without catching a real mixup -- the
    id is only ever handed straight back to the surface that produced it.

    One registry entry serves a whole session key, and that key can span several
    conversations: under ``messaging.dm_scope = "unified"`` every allow-listed
    person's direct chat collapses into one key, and a group space routes as
    ``space:{room_id}`` under ANY scope. So the lines on one bubble may come from
    several conversations while ``msg_id`` names a message in exactly ONE of them --
    the one the bubble was opened in. Everything below follows from that single
    pairing, and all of it is decided on the ADDRESS rather than on who is calling:

    * only the bubble's own address may write to the bubble. ``msg_id`` is a
      per-conversation number, so the same integer in another chat is an unrelated
      message and editing it there would rewrite a stranger's post.
    * a body written to the bubble may quote only the lines that arrived at that
      same address (:meth:`texts_at_address`). One person's text must not appear in
      another person's chat, and the bubble's chat is somebody's chat.

    Deciding on the address and not on the principal is what makes both rules true
    on the two shared-key routes at once. In a group space every member's surface
    binds the same ``room_id``, so a second member's message both may and must
    update the shared bubble; under unified DM scope two members' surfaces bind
    different chats, so neither may write to the other's. A test on who is calling
    cannot tell those apart -- it is the same "somebody else" in both.

    ``opened_on`` is the surface the bubble was opened on, and :attr:`address` is
    its key. Holding the surface for the entry's life is something a surface
    supports: it closes over its channel's long-lived client plus the bound address

        Caller MUST hold :attr:`lock` across clear_queue + this call.

        ``owner`` names the ONE principal whose messages were cleared, and then only
        that person's lines are withdrawn from the record. Whether anything is written
        depends on the ADDRESS, not on who is calling:

        * the caller's surface addresses the bubble -- it finalizes as cancelled over
          the caller's OWN withdrawn lines, which arrived at that same address. Not
          over what remains: those lines may have arrived from another chat that
          merely shares this session key.
        * it does not -- nothing is written, because ``msg_id`` names a message in the
          bubble's chat and in the caller's the same number is another message
          entirely. The lines are withdrawn from the record either way.

        Both cases are preceded by a condition that has nothing to do with addressing:
        while ANY line remains after the withdraw, nothing is written at all. Those
        messages are still queued, so "Cancelled" would say they went and a re-render
        would show their text.

        The entry is dropped once it owes nothing. It is RETAINED in exactly one case:
        the finalizing edit did not land, so the entry carries the record it owes and
        is terminal. That is safe against a later drain for the same reason the
        addressing rule holds -- an owed record is written through
        :attr:`QueueReceipt.opened_on`, the surface the bubble was opened on, so no
        transition is ever handed an id minted in a different chat. A retained entry is
        not live and is never grown, so a later burst opens a fresh bubble rather than
        joining this one; which conversation a shared bubble belongs to is the registry
        key's own question.

        bubble's own: the edit targets ``msg_id``, which is another message entirely
        in any other chat, and the fallback POSTS the body as a fresh notified
        message, so a body built for one chat would arrive in a reader's chat
        unannounced. That the body is safe to show there is established where it was

        it against. An entry with no bound surface is not written at all: there is no
        address to fall back to, only the wrong one.

        Editing first is what keeps the record in the bubble the reader is already
        looking at. When the bubble refuses edits the record is POSTED instead: past
        Webex's documented per-message edit cap no edit of that id will ever land, so
        retrying alone would leave the record owed for the life of the process. The
        stale bubble still reads "⏳ Queued" and the posted record says what happened,
        which together are true; a silent bubble alone is not. The post goes to the
        bubble's own send address, so on a channel with forum Topics the record lands
        in the Topic the bubble is in rather than the parent chat.

        Several records can be owed, and they are published OLDEST FIRST: the oldest
        goes into the bubble, and each later one is POSTED beneath it, which is the
        order they happened in and so the order a reader must read them in. Only the
        oldest can take the bubble -- there is one bubble and the rest arrived after it.

        The bubble is spent by the FIRST record that reaches the reader, whether it got
        there by edit or by post, and that is remembered on the entry. A later call must
        not edit again: the bubble sits above everything posted beneath it, so editing a
        later body into it would both erase the record already shown there and put the
        two records in the wrong order for whoever reads them.

        Records released by the cap are named once, on the first body to reach the
        reader, and the count is cleared when that body lands. A shortened list is
        otherwise indistinguishable from a burst that produced no such records.

        Each body is dropped from the debt only once it LANDS, one at a time, so a
        failure partway through keeps exactly what has not reached anybody. Returns
        whether the debt is now empty.
