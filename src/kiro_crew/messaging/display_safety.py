"""Redaction against what a chat platform will DISPLAY, not the bytes it is sent.

Every channel scans outbound text for credentials, but a scan of the literal
bytes is not enough on any platform that renders markup away: ``AKIA**REST**``
and ``[AKIA](https://x)REST`` match no credential pattern as written, yet the
reader sees an intact key once the delimiters are stripped at render time. The
transformation happens AFTER the scan, so the scan has to anticipate it.

This lives in ``messaging`` rather than in one channel package because the
hazard is not Slack-specific: Telegram (MarkdownV2) and Discord (Markdown)
collapse the same emphasis, code-span and link syntax. It was written for
Slack first and hoisted here when :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.renderer.
format_overflow` began putting LLM-authored choice text into the message BODY
on every widget-capable channel -- the shared sink cannot depend on each
renderer remembering to canonicalise, which is the same reasoning that put the
``max_buttons`` cap in shared code.

Stdlib-only leaf: it takes the redactor as a parameter rather than importing
``kiro_crew.security``, so it stays importable from anywhere and each caller
keeps its own (possibly session-scoped) redactor.

    A cap that cuts text into two messages is applied to the RAW string, while the
    reader sees the CANONICAL rendering of each piece. So a credential the model
    split with markup can be severed by the cut: each piece is scrubbed on its own
    and matches nothing, and the reader's client renders the markup away and
    rejoins the halves on screen.

    This answers the question directly rather than guessing which characters could
    hide such a split. Each side is put through the same redaction the sender will
    actually apply (:func:`redact_for_display`), then reduced to what the platform
    SHOWS (:func:`canonicalize_display`), and the result of putting the two sides
    together is scanned.

    Soundness, which is the whole point: ``redact_for_display`` already emits the
    canonical form whenever canonicalising reveals something the literal form hid,
    and likewise whenever the plain-text reading (links kept, delimiters dropped)
    reveals a key the canonical form dropped along with a link's url. On those
    branches the emitted text has been rendered again until rendering it changes
    nothing, so it IS its own canonical reading and that reading scans clean; on
    the pass-through branch the text's canonical reading is the ``canonical`` the
    function already scanned clean. Either way, for any single string ``x``,
    ``canonicalize_display(redact_for_display(x)[0])`` is text the redactor
    leaves unchanged. Whatever this scan finds is therefore
    produced by putting the two sides together and by nothing else. No character
    class, no window and no
    anchor list: a search window built from a hand-written set of characters cannot
    be closed, because the next character the set does not know about is one more
    place a split can hide -- the walk that finds the window's edge stops there, the
    check runs on a span the credential's prefix was never inside, and it passes
    vacuously.

    BOTH readings a reader can produce are scanned, because neither one contains
    the other:

    * **canonicalise the join** models a COPY of both messages, and a client
      lenient about where one message ends. It is the wider reading for runs of
      delimiters, which concatenation can only extend: ``AKIA**`` beside
      ``**REST`` is a run only once the halves sit together.
    * **canonicalise each side, then join** models the screen -- two messages
      rendered separately, read one after the other. This is the wider reading
      wherever canonicalising DROPS text rather than just deleting delimiters,
      which is exactly what a link does to its target. A cut one character inside
      ``[l](https://x/AKIA`` + ``REST)`` completes the link only in the join,
      where the url then collapses to the label and the key vanishes from the
      scan -- while on screen each half is an unfinished link whose url stays
      visible, and the reader reads straight through it.

    So the join alone would pass a cut through a credential in a url, and the
    per-side reading alone would miss a credential split by markup at the
    boundary. Either reading finding something is enough to refuse the cut, and
    ``test_display_split_safety.py`` pins one shape per reading.

    The further readings :func:`redact_for_display` scans
    (:data:`FURTHER_READINGS`) are taken both ways as well, because a pair has to
    be graded under every reading a single message is: Telegram's fallback and its
    HTML seal both drop a heading marker, so a field name closing one message and
    ``#   : <value>`` opening the next read as the assignment on screen, while the
    literal join and the canonical form both keep the ``#`` between them and scan
    clean. Each reading is scanned once, and the scan stops at the first that
    shows a key.

    split severed matches nothing in any single message -- and the reader's client
    renders the markup away and reads the pieces one under the other, in order, as
    one text.

    Two readings, because neither subsumes the other:

    * **the whole sequence**, every piece redacted alone and then put together. This
      is what catches a key whose MARKUP spans an entire piece rather than whose
      characters do: cut ``AKIA[KEYTAIL](http://host/<long>)`` into three and no
      neighbouring pair canonicalises to anything (the link needs its closing
      bracket, which is in the third piece), while the full join collapses the url
      to the label and puts the label against ``AKIA``. Piece length is no defence
      here -- canonicalising DROPS a link's target, so a piece of any size can
      vanish entirely.
    * **each boundary read BOTH ways round** -- everything after it, and everything
      before it. This is the reading that survives a pattern anchored at its edges:
      the reader sees a message break where the whole-sequence join sees the next
      character, so a key completed at the end of one piece must be caught even when
      later text would spoil the match. Both ways, because the patterns anchor on
      BOTH sides: reading only forwards misses a key finished at a boundary whose
      NEXT piece opens on a character the trailing class rejects, which every
      forward reading carries.

    Every piece is put through the same redaction the sender will apply and then
    reduced to what the platform SHOWS, exactly as :func:`joins_to_a_credential`
    does for a single cut. Soundness rests on the same property:
    ``redact_for_display`` is already a fixed point for one string, so whatever
    either reading finds is produced by putting pieces together and by nothing else.
    One piece therefore answers False: there is no boundary.

    *present* maps a piece to the form the platform will actually DELIVER, and when
    it is given BOTH forms are graded -- a sever in either answers True. Both,
    because neither form dominates the other and a caller that picked one would miss
    the half the other sees:

    * trimming REVEALS a join. ``AKIAIOSF\\n\\n`` and ``   ODNN7EXAMPLE`` are kept
      apart by whitespace no credential pattern tolerates, and sit flush on screen
      once the sink strips it.
    * trimming CONCEALS one. ``-----BEGIN `` and ``RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`` need that
      trailing space to match, so the trimmed pair reads clean while the delivered
      pair -- on a sink that does not trim, or trims less than modelled -- is an
      intact PEM anchor.

    So "model more trimming and the grade only gets stricter" is FALSE, and grading
    the delivered form alone is not the safe direction. Grading both is.

    True means the split is unusable and the caller must cut somewhere else (see

    between two samples is passed over. Those characters are not lost, only
    deferred to the next delivery.

    Used by a renderer whose message cap forces *text* into two deliveries: cut
    here and :func:`joins_to_a_credential` is false of both forms, so the reader
    cannot rejoin a key across the boundary.

    Candidates step back EXPONENTIALLY (``limit``, then 1, 2, 4, 8 ... characters
    before it), for a cost bound: the nearest safe boundary is not needed, only a
    safe one, and stepping past it merely defers a few more characters to the next
    delivery. A linear walk would be O(*limit*) redaction passes over
    attacker-influenced text on every frame; this is O(log *limit*), and the common
    case -- prose, where any cut is safe -- costs one pass, or none at all when
    *text* already fits.

    ``0`` means every SAMPLED candidate was unsafe -- one matched region covers all
    of them. A safe offset between two samples may still exist; the search does not
    look for it, because the answer it needs is only "is there a safe cut I can take
    now". Callers treat ``0`` as "deliver nothing yet", which is always available to
    them: text withheld now is text the next delivery carries.

    """Redact *text* against what the platform will DISPLAY, not just the bytes.

    Two normalisations, for the same underlying reason: a transformation applied
    *after* the scan can reassemble a credential the scanner saw as broken.

    1. **ANSI escapes** -- stripped outright, because they are display noise with
       no meaning to preserve.
    2. **Link markup and emphasis/code delimiters** -- these DO carry meaning, so
       they cannot simply be deleted. Instead the canonical (display) form is
       scanned as well. Neither ``AKIA**<rest>**`` nor ``[AKIA](https://x)<rest>``
       matches a credential pattern as written, yet the platform renders the
       markup away and shows the reader an intact key.

    When the canonical form reveals a secret that the literal form hid, the
    canonical text is emitted -- so the message loses that markup. That is
    deliberate and one-directional: formatting is worth less than a credential, and
    the downgrade only happens on a message that actually contains one.

    The canonical form drops every url, because a rendering platform shows only a
    link's label. Telegram's plain-text fallback can instead print that url after
    the Markdown screen has run, removing fences, inline code, ``**`` and ``__``
    and then flattening a link to ``label (url)``, in that relative order.
    :func:`_plain_reading` applies the same pattern objects and replacements
    (:data:`TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_PASSES`, which the renderer imports from here), so
    the screen and the sink cannot drift. The order matters as much as the set:
    the fallback's link pass runs after its delimiter passes, so it links
    ``AKIA[IOSF...]**(u)**`` once the ``**`` is gone, where the screen's own link
    pass, running first, sees text. Telegram's heading rewrite is shared because
    removing its marker can expose a named credential assignment; its bullet
    rewrite keeps a visible bullet between the runs and remains renderer-local.
    When the fallback reading reveals a key, the canonical redacted form is
    emitted, taking the key away with the link's target or, for a link the
    delimiter passes close, with the link itself once the settling passes below
    have collapsed it.

    The screen also scans a depth-unbounded balanced close, a lazy first-``)``
    close, and a link-free reading that leaves every url visible. A key only one
    of these readings reveals is answered with the canonical redacted form.

    A text that changes on any route is emitted only once it shows a key under no
    reading (:func:`_settled_under_every_reading`). The canonical redacted form is
    preferred, because it carries no url; where a reading still joins a key across
    a link the canonical grammar kept raw, that reading is redacted and settled,
    and the result is scanned under every reading again. One text can carry a key
    one reading joins and a second key another reading joins, so answering the
    first reading alone would hand the reader the second. The passes are bounded;
    text still showing a key at the bound is stripped of every markup character
    outside a redactor-owned tag, which leaves no reading anything to join
    outside a tag.

    The canonical form emitted on any route is rendered again until rendering
    it changes nothing (:func:`settled_display_form`, bounded, then stripped of
    markup), because canonicalising can close a link that the scanned reading
    still showed as text: the emphasis pass turns ``[AKIA]*(u)`` into ``[AKIA](u)``
    after the link pass has gone by, so the scan cleared a text whose own
    rendering joins the key.

    Every form scanned is the whole text, tags included, because that is what a
    reader is shown. Every form EMITTED is rendered outside the tags the redactor
    wrote (:func:`redacted_rendering`): a tag is an atom, and a rendering that
    read ``[REDACTED: credential](rotated)`` as a link would emit the bare label,
    delete the remark and leave the delivered text with no tag to count.

    Returns:
        ``(safe_text, redacted)``. ``redacted`` is True when the redactor changed
        anything, by any route -- callers that already published the text rely
        on it to go back and replace what is visible.
