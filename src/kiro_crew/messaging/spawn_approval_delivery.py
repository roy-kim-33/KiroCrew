"""Channel-side delivery for the host spawn-approval prompt — one seam, every channel.

The single host-wide ``SubagentManager`` owns ONE ``on_spawn_approval`` callback,
built in ``slack/gateway.py``, whose own surfaces are a Slack owner DM and the
dashboard. Neither one can be answered by the person who started a spawn from a
Telegram (or any other) channel conversation, and the gate refuses such a spawn
fast with ``no_approval_surface`` rather than parking it to the reaper's
deadline. The prompt belongs on the ORIGINATING channel's own inline keyboard,
which each channel already renders for mid-run tool prompts but which the host
spawn gate cannot reach by itself — the driver's per-turn ``decider`` is wired to
the main-agent tool ladder, not to this callback.

This module is that reach: a process-global registry a channel dispatcher
registers a delivery hook into, keyed by the channel namespace it owns
(``telegram``, ``slack``, …). The spawn-approval callback consults it FIRST,
given the spawn's ``parent_session_key``, and:

* a hook returning ``True``/``False`` is the user's in-channel decision — run or
  reject — and the callback returns it verbatim;
* a hook returning ``None`` means "this channel is registered but could not
  surface the prompt for THIS session" (an unroutable key, a send that failed),
  so the callback falls through to the existing Slack-DM/dashboard path exactly
  as before;
* no hook registered for the session's channel is the same fall-through.

Why a registry keyed by channel namespace rather than by ``parent_session_key``:
a channel runs one dispatcher for the whole process, and the session's channel is
already recoverable from its key prefix (``messaging.link.channel_namespace_of``),
which is the authoritative classifier the rest of the system uses. Keying by the
full session key would need the gate to know every live session, which is exactly
the coupling the seam exists to avoid.

In memory only, deliberately, and modelled on ``messaging/session_trust.py``: a
delivery hook is a live object on a running dispatcher, so a registration that
survived a restart would name a dispatcher that is already gone. The registry
dies with the process; a channel re-registers on its next startup.

``messaging`` may not import a channel package, so the hook is a plain async
callable the channel supplies — the same inversion ``session_trust`` uses to let
a Slack widget write a grant a Telegram turn can read.

    *hook* is the registration the caller believes it owns, and supplying it makes
    this a COMPARE-AND-DROP. Two dispatcher lifetimes can overlap: a restart
    registers the replacement hook (``register_channel_delivery`` replaces the
    slot) before the OLD client's close callback runs, and an unconditional pop
    there removes the LIVE replacement — leaving the channel with no delivery
    surface at all, which the gate reads as "fall through to Slack/dashboard" for
    every later spawn until the next restart. Comparing first makes a stale close
    a no-op. Equality rather than identity because the registered hook is a bound
    method: each ``dispatcher.deliver_spawn_approval`` attribute access mints a new
    object, and two of them compare equal exactly when they name the same method on
    the same dispatcher, which is the question being asked here.

    Omitted, the drop stays unconditional for a caller holding no handle on its own
