"""Channel-neutral ``!temporary`` / ``!incognito`` session privacy modifiers.

Two modes, and what each one actually forbids:

Temporary (blank-slate)
    No memory reads, no memory writes, no persistence. The session starts with
    zero context and discards everything on close.
Incognito
    Memory reads are allowed but writes are blocked; the ephemeral conversation
    log is discarded on close.

Both are tracked in bounded LRUs keyed by **session key**, never by a platform
thread id. That is what lets one copy of the machinery serve a Slack thread ts,
a Telegram DM route and a Telegram forum Topic without any of them colliding —
and it is why :func:`is_restricted` answers correctly for a
``telegram:{agent}:direct:{user}`` key, which a ``startswith("slack:")`` test
never could. The LRUs are process-local; :func:`hydrate` rebuilds them from the
durable ``SessionMap`` flag so a mode survives a gateway restart.

What a second channel must supply
---------------------------------
Everything platform-shaped is a parameter, because this module may not import
``kiro_crew.slack`` or ``kiro_crew.dashboard`` — not even function-locally (the
one-way dependency invariant in ``docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md``):

* ``source`` — the channel name, e.g. ``"slack"``. It is the audit label and
  nothing else: the SEL operation is ``f"{source}.{mode}_mode"`` and the event's
  ``source`` field is ``source`` verbatim.
* ``sessions`` — the ``SessionManager``. Supplying it makes the mode DURABLE, in
  two records for two readers: the per-conversation flag in the one
  :class:`~kiro_crew.session_map.SessionMap` instance it owns (so the durable
  flag cannot be clobbered by a second instance's save), which is what
  :func:`hydrate` restores the trackers from on every inbound message and which
  keeps the entry alive through ``SessionMap.prune``; and ``memory_mode`` in the
  session's own transcript header, the field every memory reader already
  honours (``is_incognito_transcript``), so a transcript read never depends on
  the map being loaded. Omit it and the mode is in-memory only, which is also
  what a test double passing no ``sessions`` gets. The header write goes through
  the default ``ConversationLog``: every production log reads the one configured
  sessions directory, so it reaches the same file the channel writes.
* ``notify`` — an awaitable that delivers one confirmation message on the
  channel. The text is :data:`NOTICE_TEMPORARY` / :data:`NOTICE_INCOGNITO`, held
  here so two channels cannot describe the same mode differently.
* ``on_applied`` — optional, awaited once per NEWLY applied mode for the
  bookkeeping a mode change implies on that channel. Slack registers the thread
  (``set_slack_link``) so follow-up messages pass its in-active-thread gate; a
  channel that routes off the conversation id has nothing to do here.

Two entry points, because the two shapes are genuinely different:

* :func:`strip_and_apply` — one text in, ``(stripped_text, only_modifier)`` out.
  This is what a channel whose inbound message is a single string calls.
* :func:`strip_token` + :func:`apply_mode` — the primitives. Slack drives these
  directly because it carries TWO texts (the LLM-facing message and the
  mention-stripped command text) and only the command text decides whether the
  message was nothing BUT a modifier.

Applying a mode is idempotent: a repeat ``!incognito`` in an already-incognito
session neither re-audits nor re-notifies, so a user cannot spam the channel by
repeating the token.

One path from a request to a published mode
--------------------------------------------
Every mode a caller asks for -- a modifier on a message (:func:`apply_mode`), a
reservation ahead of a steer (:func:`reserve`) -- is published by exactly one
function, :func:`_commit_mode`, whose docstring is the ONE statement of the
order (its numbered steps; nothing here or at the callers restates them, so
there is one text to drift): the durable records first, awaited to disk, and
the publication only after them. A write that fails publishes nothing and refuses the turn
(``persist_failed``): the user is told the message was NOT processed, never
that a mode is on which the next boot would not find. While the row is landing
the session is already HELD as restricted by every predicate here
(:func:`is_restricted` and its siblings read the pending registry beside the
trackers) -- fail-closed, not published: nothing is announced, and the hold
vanishes with the write if it fails. The mirror, :func:`_release_mode`, takes a
reservation back the same way: durable clear awaited first, then the header
restored to the strictest claim still standing and the mark dropped; a clear
that fails RETAINS the mode. ``test_messaging_privacy_mode`` pins the shape
structurally: ``set_flag`` and ``aflush`` are called nowhere but :func:`_land`,
and :func:`mark` nowhere but the primitive, :func:`hydrate` (which restores
from the durable map and skips a row still landing) and the two in-memory
wrappers a caller with no durable store uses.

    The SECOND durable record of a mode, and a required one: the session map
    flag is what the channel's own gate hydrates from and what keeps the map
    entry alive through ``SessionMap.prune``; the transcript header is the field
    every memory reader refuses on (``is_incognito_transcript``, the
    consolidator's header source, the dashboard's persisted probe, the
    consolidate route's own header probe) AND the one record the out-of-process
    gates consult -- ``execution_context.capture_session_execution`` reads the
    header alone and treats an absent ``memory_mode`` as ``persistent``, and MCP
    ``register_hook``, the task runner and workflow memory decide on that. So a
    header write that fails cannot be "best effort": a message run under a mode
    the header does not carry would let a hook register durable state under
    Incognito. :func:`_commit_mode` therefore writes it INSIDE the durable step,
    after the row and before the mark, and a failure here rolls the row back and
    refuses the message. Two records rather than one because they answer two
    readers: a transcript read must not depend on the map being loaded, and the
    channel gate must not pay a transcript read per inbound message.

    Upserted through ``ConversationLog.update_metadata_if``: a transcript that
    does not exist yet gets a metadata-only line, and ``ConversationLog.append``
    keeps an existing header, so the first row any later writer appends lands
    under a header that already carries the mode. Tighten-only: the guard
    admits the write only when *mode* is at least as strict as the header's
    current mode, so ``!incognito`` typed after ``!temporary`` cannot re-enable
    memory reads, and a header already carrying *mode* is rewritten unchanged
    (no write at all -- not a failure).

    The writer's answer is consumed and then NOT trusted on its own: the header
    is read back, and the stamp counts only when the header records at least
    *mode* (:class:`HeaderNotRecorded` otherwise, refused by the caller like a
    write that raised). ``update_metadata_if`` has two silent no-write returns
    that read as success -- a damaged first line it reports unreadable
    (``False``, the same answer as "already carries the mode"), and a first line
    that is valid JSON but not the metadata record (a legacy message-first
    transcript), which ``_update_metadata_locked`` skips and still reports
    written -- and either would have marked, audited and announced a mode the
    header-only gates could not see.

    The default ``ConversationLog`` reaches the same file the channel writes:
    every production log reads the one configured sessions directory. Off the
    loop, because ``update_metadata_if`` takes the transcript's cross-process
    flock. The startup sweep (``SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers``) re-stamps
    every flagged row's header from its row, which repairs a header a cancelled
    task left behind; it is a repair pass, not what makes this write optional.

       write or land (``persist_failed``) ends here -- :func:`refuse` writes one

       no mark, no header, no notice, so nothing claims a mode the next boot
       would not find. (The best-effort form this replaces kept the mark and
       reported the mode on when its flush failed; a restart then ran the
       thread persistent under a mode-on notice.)
    2. The durable header: :func:`_persist_transcript_mode`, tighten-only, READ
       BACK after the write (the writer's answer is not the record: its two
       silent no-write returns are :class:`HeaderNotRecorded`). The record the
       out-of-process gates read (``capture_session_execution`` and the MCP
       ``register_hook``, task-runner and workflow-memory paths on it, which
       take an absent header as ``persistent``). A header write that fails, or
       returns with the header not recording the mode, is the same refusal as a
       row that cannot land: the row is rolled back (:func:`_land` to its prior
       value, best-effort -- a row left behind is over-restrictive and the
       startup sweep stamps its header at the next boot) and the message is NOT
       processed. Before the mark, so no message can run under a mode one of
       its two records does not carry; the key is HELD as restricted for the
       span of both writes.
    3. The mark -- :func:`mark`, the in-process publication every enforcement
       site reads. Both records it announces are on disk.
    4. The SEL ``allowed`` record. (A task cancelled during step 2 leaves the
       row on disk with neither mark nor record: the next inbound message
       hydrates the mark from the row, and the sweep restores the header.)
    5. The caller's hook, then the notice -- unless the caller defers it
       (``announce=False``: :func:`reserve`, whose confirmation is
       :func:`commit`'s to send once the step it protects has happened; a
       refusal's notice is never deferred).

    Always ``True``: idempotency is the caller's check, made before the group
    is entered, so a repeat request never reaches the write. A caller with no
    durable store (``sessions`` is ``None``, or not a real ``SessionMap``) has
    no row to land; it still gets the header when ``sessions`` is given, and is

    The commit lands its records strict-first -- the row, the header, then the
    mark. The release loosens them in the OPPOSITE order, so that a sequence
    that stops anywhere leaves the record the next boot trusts still saying the
    mode: :func:`hydrate` restores the mark from the map ROW alone, and the
    startup sweep (``SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers``) re-stamps headers FROM
    rows, never rows from headers -- so the row is the last record loosened.

    1. The durable header, restored to :func:`_restore_target` -- the strictest
       of what it recorded before this reservation and every other mode still
       standing on the session, never a bare ``persistent`` while another mode
       holds the conversation. Written only if the header still records the
       released mode, and then READ BACK: a restore that raises, or that leaves
       the header still recording the released mode when its target was another
       value (the writer's silent no-write answers, see
       :class:`HeaderNotRecorded`), RETAINS the mode with NOTHING loosened yet
       -- the row and the mark stand as they were, one ``retained`` record
       reports the failure in place of ``released``, and ``False`` is returned.
       (Cleared first, the row was put back after a failed restore; a put-back
       that failed too left the row clear under a header and a mark that still
       said the mode, and the next boot hydrated nothing from it -- the channel
       gate read the session as persistent while every header-only reader still
       read it private.) A header left STRICTER than the release's target is
       not a failure -- another mode's commit landed meanwhile, and stricter is
       the safe direction.
    2. The durable clear: :func:`_land` clears the map flag and AWAITS the
       landing (the row stops counting against the cap; a row that carries
       another privacy flag keeps that one). A clear that fails RETAINS the
       mode: the flag is back in the map's memory (the map's next write
       retries), the mark never left, and the header loosened a step ago is
       re-stamped with the mode (:func:`_persist_transcript_mode`, tighten-only)
       so the two records agree again at once -- best effort in the SAFE
       direction, since where that re-stamp fails too the row still says the
       mode: this process stays restricted, the next boot hydrates the mark from
       the row, and the startup sweep re-stamps the header from it.
    3. The mark, dropped -- the one place this module unpublishes -- and the
       SEL ``released`` record. Only once both records are loosened on disk.
       Then the claims of the other groups pending on the session are re-rooted
       (:func:`_reroot_claims`): a group that read this mode off the header
       when it reserved must restore what stood BEFORE this mode, not this mode.

    The whole sequence runs under the session's durable-write lock
    (:func:`_serialized`), shared with :func:`_commit_mode`: two modes on one
    key are two groups, and two releases interleaved each read the other's mode
    as a standing claim -- both wrote the other mode into the header, both then
    retired, and the header stayed private over a session with no row, mark or
    group left on it. Serialized, the first release sees the second's claim and
    restores to it; the second sees nothing standing and restores what the
    header held before either.

    A cancellation during the durable steps does NOT abandon the sequence: the
    header write is a thread the cancellation cannot stop and the clear's flush
    may already be on its way, so both steps run as one task SHIELDED from this
    one, their outcome is awaited, and the sequence completes -- released or
    retained -- before the cancellation propagates. Only a SECOND cancellation
    while that outcome is awaited propagates at once, leaving the outcome to
    the shielded task: whatever it lands, the row is loosened last, so a boot
    that reads a half-finished release reads the mode.
