"""Channel-neutral recent-sessions collector.

Every surface that offers a "recent sessions" list — the Slack slash command,
the Slack Home Tab, and a chat channel's ``/sessions`` — needs the same three
answers about each transcript on disk: what it is called, which agent ran it,
and whether it is live. That reading is pure filesystem work with no channel in
it, so it lives here and each surface owns only its own rendering.

Dependency direction stays one-way: this module imports ``config.paths``,
``history`` and ``security``, and nothing from ``kiro_crew.slack`` /
``kiro_crew.dashboard``.

    ``history._safe_key`` folds every ``:`` in a session key to ``_`` to build
    the filename, and that fold is not reversible: nothing in
    ``slack_C123.1700000000`` says which underscores were colons. Two cases can
    still be answered:

    * ``dashboard_`` has exactly one colon, at a fixed position, so *stem_key*
      arrives already unfolded from the caller;
    * a CHANNEL session's unfolded key is held by the session map, and
      ``SessionManager.channel_key_for_stem`` is the only authority on it. An
      empty answer means "not knowable", and then the folded spelling stands.

    Getting this wrong is not cosmetic here. The key decides ``has_session``,
    so a live Slack conversation read under its folded spelling looks idle --
    which now means its row is HIDDEN if it carries a dismissal, and the End
    button on that row carries a key naming no live session, so it writes the
    dismissal without stopping the process it appeared to end. It is also the
    key the Resume and End buttons carry, so the resolved spelling is what
    makes those buttons address the session the channel is actually running.

    *sessions* is duck-typed (the collector documents only ``has_session``), so
    the resolver is optional and its absence simply leaves the fold in place.

    The answer is VERIFIED rather than trusted: it counts only when folding it
    back reproduces the stem that was asked about, the same check
    ``messaging.session_resume`` applies to this resolver. Binding a row to a
    key the filename does not fold to would put the End button on one

    THE definition of "ended" for every surface that lists sessions, so the
    End button, the row marker and the opt-in cannot drift apart.

    *dismissed* is the transcript metadata's ``closed`` flag — the durable
    record that the user put this conversation away, written by the Slack End
    button and by a dashboard tab close. There is one such record per
    transcript: a tab and its channel conversation share the file, so a
    dismissal is stored once and every surface reads the same one.

    A live session outranks the flag. ``has_session`` is true only while a
    process is actually serving the key, so a resumed conversation is back in
    the list immediately, without waiting for anyone to rewrite the file.

    The flag alone otherwise decides, and deliberately **not** "unless the
    file was written after the dismissal", which is how
    ``dashboard.channel_slots._close_stands`` reads the same flag for the
    dashboard's own listing. The two surfaces are answering different
    questions. That one asks whether a conversation outran a closed tab and
    compares against the channel's last write. This one asks whether the user
    still wants the row, and background housekeeping writes the file without
    the user doing anything — consolidation on end, skill extraction, an
    auto-title. Letting any write undo the dismissal would put the row

    ``_SESSIONS_MAX_PREVIEW`` user/assistant messages, truncated to
    ``_SESSIONS_MAX_MSG_CHARS`` chars but **not** redacted — redaction
    happens in ``_build_sessions_blocks`` via ``session_task_card``).

    *sessions* is an optional ``SessionManager``-like object exposing
    ``has_session(key) -> bool`` for the active marker. Pass ``None`` to
    skip the active check (returned ``active`` will always be ``False``).

    *kind* filters by ``_SESSION_KIND_*``. Accepts a single kind string,
    an iterable of kinds (the Home Tab uses this to fetch dashboard +
    taskrunner in a single directory scan), or ``None`` for no filter.

    *include_ended* keeps rows the user has dismissed. Default ``False``: a
    dismissed row is what the End button promises to take away, and leaving
    it in means End appears to do nothing while the row still competes for
    one of *limit* slots. See :func:`_row_is_ended` for what counts.

    Sorted by last HUMAN activity descending, capped at *limit*. The rank key is
    a session's ``last_user_at`` metadata stamp when it has one and its
    ``st_mtime`` when it does not, because mtime measures machine activity: a
    cron wake, a monitor loop, a subagent, or any bulk pass over the directory
    rewrites the file and reorders the whole list, and a pass that iterates in
    activity order inverts it. The kind filter still needs no file open (kind
    comes from the filename stem), and the rank costs ONE line per candidate --
    line 0 is always the metadata line -- so only the newest *limit*
    matching transcripts are read in FULL. It is the whole-transcript reads that
    stay capped at *limit*, not the scan: the one-line rank read does grow with
    the directory, by one open and one short read per file, which is what a
    content-based rank costs and what ``stat`` cannot answer.

    Three things are skipped: an empty file, an unreadable one, and a
    dismissed row. Skipping keeps going down the rank order rather than ending
    the scan, so the result still holds *limit* rows whenever enough usable
    transcripts exist. The first two are corrupt-file cases; a dismissal is an
    ORDINARY state, so with the *n* highest-ranked rows dismissed, *n*
    transcripts are read and discarded before the first row is kept. That cost
    is accepted rather than avoided, because the flag lives on the metadata
    line and cannot be read from ``stat``, and because the alternative --
    letting a dismissed row hold its slot -- is the bug this exists to fix. It
    is bounded by the directory and cheap to bound further:
    ``with_messages=False`` reads only line 0, which is where the flag is.

    This function performs synchronous filesystem I/O (directory scan plus
    up to *limit* whole-file reads plus one per skipped candidate, each
    bounded only by transcript size).
    Callers on the asyncio event loop MUST use

    Reading this directory reaches into the operator's data home and hands what it
    finds to an external surface, so the read is audited — on BOTH outcomes. The
    failure path is the one that matters most and the one easiest to leave out: an
    I/O error that is not audited makes the access attempt invisible to the
    security pipeline, which is exactly when knowing someone asked is worth most.

    Every surface that lists sessions owes the same two events with the same
    resource strings, so they live here rather than being re-typed per channel —
    a fourth copy is how one of them ends up auditing only the success.

    *caller* and *source* are the audit's subject and surface (e.g. a session key
    and ``"telegram"``). Returns the rows, or ``None`` when the collector failed
    and the caller only has to choose its own wording.

    No ``include_ended`` passthrough: this wrapper has no callers yet, so the
    parameter would be a surface nothing exercises. Add it with the first caller
    that needs it.
