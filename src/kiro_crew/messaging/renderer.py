"""Layer 2 -- abstract output events + the ``Renderer`` contract.

The ``TurnDriver`` consumes provider events and emits the channel-neutral
``OutputEvent`` stream defined here. Each transport supplies a ``Renderer``
that maps those abstract events onto its native surface.

``prompt_choice`` is a FIRST-CLASS event (not generic "permission text"):
each Renderer maps it to its native interactive widget. ``[OPTIONS: a | b]``
trailers are the TEXT path: each widget-capable renderer re-parses the
trailer from its own accumulated text and MUST route the parsed list through
:func:`apply_options_cap` before building widgets, so at most
``capabilities.max_buttons`` choices render interactively and the remainder
degrades to a numbered text list the user can answer by typing. The cap is
ENFORCED (see ``test/test_capability_ledger.py``) and pinned per channel by
the cross-channel contract test in ``test/test_options_cap_contract.py`` —
a widget-capable renderer that skips the helper fails that test.
Channels declaring ``max_buttons=0`` render no widget and route the whole
trailer through :func:`render_options_as_text`, which reaches the same helper
with zero widget slots: every choice becomes a numbered line the user answers by
typing, rather than being deleted along with the trailer.
