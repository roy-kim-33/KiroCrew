"""Cron execution history store.

Persists run records as JSONL files per job, with a global index for
cross-job queries.  Uses fcntl advisory locking for cross-process safety.

Storage layout:
    ~/.kiro/crew/cron-history/
        {job_id}.jsonl      — full records (including trace) for one job
        _index.jsonl        — lightweight index (no trace) for list queries

History is BEST-EFFORT.  When the directory cannot be created or written the
store constructs anyway with ``enabled`` False: reads return empty, writes are
dropped, and nothing raises.  A runtime failure on a store that DID construct
degrades the same way (``_degrade``) rather than propagating, so the invariant
holds at the store itself instead of relying on every caller to wrap it.
Losing run records must never take scheduling down with it — see
``_prepare_dir`` for how usability is decided, and ``prepare()`` for why a
loop-bound caller must resolve that off the event loop.

def truncate_summary(text: str, cap: int) -> str:
    """Cut ``text`` to ``cap`` characters without dropping what makes it findable.

    The summary is the only SHORT, INDEXED record of a cron run — the trace is
    capped separately (50 KB) and is not in the index — so the summary is what a
    later session searches. A blind ``text[:cap]`` keeps a summary's opening and
    throws away its conclusion, which is exactly where the outcome and the URL of
    whatever the run produced both sit: a run that opens a pull request records
    the link at the end, so a cut that drops the end leaves nothing findable and
    the next session re-derives the same pull request.

    What survives, in this order:

    1. as much of the head as still fits, cut BEFORE a URL rather than through
       one;
    2. one ``...`` marker standing for everything removed, dropped only when
       charging it would leave the result with no URL at all;
    3. as many URLs as the remaining budget holds, newest first and each one
       whole — half a link is not findable, so a URL is kept entire or not at
       all, with only the prose around it trimmed off;
    4. the end of the final non-blank line, where a run states how it finished.

    A URL is written once: the head stops before any copy the kept URLs or the
    outcome fragment already carry, so one fact never spends the budget twice.
    Input at or under the cap is returned unchanged, and the result never
    exceeds the cap, which makes the function a fixed point: applying it to its
    own output returns that output. When the URLs alone cannot fit, the ones
    that do are kept newest first, since the link a run has just produced is
    the one a later run needs.
