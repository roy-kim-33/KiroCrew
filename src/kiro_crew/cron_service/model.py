"""The scheduled job: what one cron job is, as the store holds it.

:class:`CronJob` is the record every other cron owner reads and writes -- the
serializer in :mod:`kiro_crew.cron_service.store` maps it to and from the
``crons.json`` entry, the schedule evaluator asks it when it fires, and the
service's run lifecycle stamps a run's outcome on it. The execution-owned pause
bookkeeping (:meth:`CronJob.record_failure` / :meth:`CronJob.record_success`)
lives with the record because both halves of the pause -- the durable reason and
the in-memory ``enabled`` it is folded into -- are fields of it.
