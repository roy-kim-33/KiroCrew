"""Per-directory consent for loading a project's own ``.kiro/skills``.

A ``SKILL.md`` is prose, not code, but it enters the agent's context and can
instruct the agent to run anything. Loading one out of whatever repository the
operator happens to open is therefore an execution-adjacent decision: a cloned
repository could ship instructions the operator never read. This module is the
consent record that gates it.

Trust is keyed on the **canonical** project directory (``os.path.realpath``),
because the directory *is* the resource. Keying on any softer identity -- a
display name, a slug, an index entry -- leaves the unkeyed component forgeable:
a second name aliasing one directory would grant itself separate trust, and a
rename would orphan the record.

Storage is ``<data home>/trust/project-skills.json``. That directory is already
a whole-directory entry on the keystone deny list, so the agent's own file tools
can neither read nor write this store; like every other keystone reader, this
module opens the path directly rather than through the agent file gate.

The gate fails **closed** everywhere: an unreadable store, a malformed store, or
an unreadable config all yield "nothing is trusted" rather than a permissive
default. Refusing to load a skill costs the operator a click; loading one they
did not consent to cannot be undone.
