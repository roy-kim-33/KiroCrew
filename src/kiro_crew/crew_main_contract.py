"""The root session's automatic card: its numbers, as one type and one provider.

The chain is ``crew log -> fold -> build_crew_main -> the card's data``, and a number never
passes through a model. The card itself is the automatic session card the dashboard
already shows (``dashboard/card_lifecycle.py``); its layout stays the model's. What this
module takes away from the model is every number: :func:`build_crew_main` turns four fold
renders into :class:`CrewMainDerived`, and the model's own data is exactly
:class:`CrewMainJudgment` -- three sentences.

WHOSE CARD THIS IS. A ROOT session's, and no other slot's. The gate is
:func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.card_lifecycle.is_root_session`: no ``_created_by`` and no
session-tree parent, the same root notion the sidebar tree draws with. A worker gets no
card; its numbers are read by opening the worker.

TWO WRITERS, KEPT APART BY TYPE.

* :class:`CrewMainDerived` -- every field from a fold render. No model can reach them.
* :class:`CrewMainJudgment` -- the three sentences no fold can produce.

:func:`merge_crew_main` is the only place the two meet, and it copies every field by NAME
rather than updating a dict, so a model field can never land on a derived one. The publish
seam in ``card_lifecycle`` refuses a card whose model-written part carries a digit at all.

EVERY VALUE IS A STRING. The data island is bound by ``dashboardDocument.ts`` with
``element.textContent`` and ``normalize_card`` accepts only a flat map of strings, so
absence is carried in WORDS:

* :data:`NOT_RECORDED` -- the fold was read and does not carry this key.
* :data:`UNREADABLE` -- the fold could not be read at all.

Those two are never collapsed: a zero standing in for an unknown is the one failure a
reader cannot recover from.

NO PERCENTAGES, and every count carries its denominator in words where one exists. A bare
``3`` invites the reader to supply the total, and the total they supply is wrong.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A FIELD. The ask_question inventory is a host read no fold
carries, so there is no honest derived count of it; the two question-shaped numbers that
ARE folds appear instead (``approvals_open`` from ``approvals``, ``items_question`` from
``work``), and the question cards stay native controls.
