"""One lookup: a bound worker's slot -> its conductor's armed work-ledger loop -> fire.

WHY A MODULE OF ITS OWN. Three places learn that a worker said or did something: the
crew-log eager drain (a ``work/recorded`` entry landed), the dashboard's slot close (the
worker's session is gone), and the turn-complete hook (a worker's turn ended, with any
outcome). None of them knows anything about conductors, and each would otherwise carry
its own copy of the same four steps -- resolve the binding, find the conductor's loop,
check it is the right kind and still active, fire it. A fourth trigger is likely (an
item's acceptance promoted by a human, say), so the copy count is the thing to bound.

WHAT THE PUSH IS. :meth:`AutoNudgeService.fire_now`, and nothing else. It re-arms the
loop's own timer at delay zero, so the cycle runs inside the ordinary ``_timer`` body --
the stop sentinel, the cycle cap, the wall-clock budget, the approval stall and the
probe gate all apply exactly as on a scheduled tick. So this module moves a DEADLINE and
decides nothing: whether a turn is spent is still the gate's answer, read under the
conductor's own identity. The worker gains no handle on its conductor and sends it no
payload.

WHAT A FAILURE COSTS. Nothing that needs recovering. ``fire_now`` refuses with 404 (the
loop is not registered), 409 (not active) or 409 (mid-fire); each is logged at DEBUG and
dropped, because the conductor's scheduled tick runs the identical gate over the
identical store a cadence later and sees the same ledger. That is also why the eager
path may drop a wake under pressure and why this module never retries: the tick is the
fallback, and a push is only ever an early one.

TWO ENTRY POINTS, because the callers sit on different sides of the event loop.
:func:`fire_for_worker_slot` is for a caller already ON the gateway loop (the close
path, the turn-complete hook); :func:`fire_for_worker_slot_from_thread` is for the eager
drain, which is a plain worker thread. The split is not cosmetic: the binding is a FILE
read and the loop table is the service's own dict, so each entry point puts the file read
off the loop and every ``_loops`` read on it.
