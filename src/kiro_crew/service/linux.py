"""systemd system-service generation and control for Linux.

The unit lives at ``/etc/systemd/system/kirocrew.service`` and is
enabled+started via ``sudo systemctl enable --now``. The service runs
as the invoking user (via ``User=`` in the unit) — only the install,
uninstall, and start/stop actions need sudo.

Why system-level instead of user-level (``systemctl --user``):
some older distros (notably systemd 219) do not have a working
per-user systemd manager — ``systemctl --user`` fails with
``Failed to get D-Bus connection``. System-level units work
uniformly across any distro shipping systemd >= 219, which is
everything since 2015.

One host class this choice does NOT work on, and cannot be made to work by
anything the installer writes: an SELinux-enforcing host whose kirocrew lives
under ``$HOME`` (the default on Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite and other
atomic desktops). PID 1's domain is denied ``execute`` on a home-labelled file,
so the unit fails every start with ``203/EXEC``. :mod:`kiro_crew.service
.selinux` detects exactly that case by querying the loaded policy, and
:func:`install` refuses up front with a rendered user-scope unit as the remedy
rather than writing a unit that provably cannot start. A per-user INSTALL mode
is deliberately NOT implemented here — it is an install-model change (where the
AppArmor profile and the root-owned overrides file live) rather than a
mechanical one. The unit that remedy stands up is nevertheless first-class to
every other verb: :func:`status`, :func:`is_active`, :func:`stop`,
:func:`restart` and :func:`uninstall` look at BOTH scopes and name the one they
report on, because a health command that sees only the system unit reports a
running user-scope gateway as ``inactive (dead)``.

Sudo scope: this file escalates ``systemctl``, ``install``, ``mkdir``,
``rm``, ``rmdir`` and ``test`` directly, and lends its privileged helpers
to ``service/apparmor.py``, which adds ``apparmor_parser``, ``aa-exec``,
and — inside ``aa-exec`` — ``setpriv`` plus a trusted system ``python3``.

What each mechanism here buys is narrower than it reads, and for ``setpriv`` it
depends on which install path is running — that gap is where an audit of this
module goes wrong.

Trusted resolution buys one thing, on both paths: the interpreter is root-owned,
resolved from a fixed list of trusted system directories, and never
``sys.executable`` — which rules out escalating the venv python, the one that is
user-writable. It says nothing about what that interpreter then loads. Invoked
without ``-I``/``-S``, CPython prepends the caller's working directory to
``sys.path`` and imports ``site``, so code from that working directory,
``PYTHONPATH``, a user-site ``.pth`` line, ``sitecustomize`` or ``usercustomize``
runs before or during the payload's own first import — ``ctypes``, which a planted
module on any of those paths shadows.

WHOSE privileges that loaded code gets is what ``setpriv`` decides, and both
install paths are live. It reuids to the account the INSTALLER was invoked as
(``os.getuid()``): started as an ordinary user — the default, where this module
escalates individual commands through ``sudo`` — it reuids from sudo's root back
to that user, so the probe and anything it loads stay unprivileged; started as
``sudo kirocrew service install`` it reuids to 0, which is a no-op, and only on
that path does the loaded code run as root.

What IS bounded on both paths is the PAYLOAD: a constant stdlib snippet importing
no ``kiro_crew``, so no MCP / LLM / agent code is reached deliberately.

``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`` carries the reasoning behind the
AppArmor step's four tools. The actual gateway runs as ``User=$USER`` once
started.

    the other way a link puts a unit under our name — a link in a higher-priority
    unit directory to a file in a lower-priority one, which the loader reports by
    its resolved target — and a plain file there is the unit the installer
    wrote, marker or not (units installed before the marker existed). And the
    marker itself, :data:`MANAGED_MARKER_LINE`, in the definition file: the one
    line every unit this module renders carries, so a copy of our unit an
    operator placed or linked elsewhere is still ours to remove. One entry is
    ours by NAME rather than by definition: a mask. ``systemctl mask
    kirocrew.service`` writes a symlink to ``/dev/null`` at exactly the
    installer's own path (a mask is placed by unit name in the directory the
    installer writes to), so that entry masks OUR name, holds no definition to
    read a marker from, and is removed by unlinking it — which unmasks the
    name. A mask anywhere else (``systemctl mask --runtime`` puts it under
    ``/run``) is not at our path and is not claimed.

    Everything else is not ours: a distribution's unit under ``/usr/lib``
    loaded because no file of ours shadows it, an operator's own unit linked
    under our name, any definition with another unit's name. A file that
    cannot be read makes no claim. Nothing downstream re-decides ownership: the
    teardown arms take the :class:`OwnedUnit` this returns, or do nothing.

    and is a REFUSAL, remedied by the same restart with the right privilege from
    the right shell: ``sudo systemctl restart kirocrew`` for the system unit,
    ``systemctl --user restart kirocrew`` for the user unit, never the other
    one (under ``sudo`` the user command addresses root's manager and fails
    with ``Unit kirocrew.service not found``). The second leaves the unit
    ``failed``, ``inactive`` or in ``activating (auto-restart)``: the gateway is
    NOT UP, a hand-run restart fails the same way, and the remedy is its
    journal. A zero exit is only the manager's word that the restart job ran;

    it regardless of restart policy.

    The report is per scope (:class:`RestartReport`), and ``ok`` only when every
