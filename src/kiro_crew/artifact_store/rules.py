Every artifact-authoring surface -- the store, the dashboard handlers and the MCP

which kinds a person may pick, whether iframe content hardcodes its palette, what

      ``chat-7-1785396512`` for a dashboard-born tab, ``slack_1785370133.085469``
      for a channel-born one — on the browser create path.
    * an event's ``session_id`` comes from the caller's FULL session key —
      ``dashboard:chat-7-1785396512``, or the channel's own
      ``slack:1785370133.085469`` — because MCP callers resolve identity through
      ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` / the signed pid sidecar, which are
      scope-qualified.

    A literal comparison therefore matches the origin case and *never* the event
    case — the involvement scope would silently degrade to the plain origin
    filter it exists to widen. Each family needs the fold that turns its session
    key into its slot name, because the slot name is what the origin field
    holds:

    * a dashboard slot's name is its session key minus the ``dashboard:`` scope.
    * a channel-born slot's name is its session key run through
      ``history._safe_key`` (see ``channel_slots.channel_slot_name``) — the same
      fold that names the transcript, which is why the tab and the thread share
      one file.

    The namespace itself is never dropped: ``slack:X`` canonicalizes to
    ``slack_X``, never to ``X``, so a channel conversation cannot collide with a
    dashboard slot. Keys with no second spelling to reconcile (``cron:``,
    ``subagent:``, ``taskrunner:``) are returned untouched.
