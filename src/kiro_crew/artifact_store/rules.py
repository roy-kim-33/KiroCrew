"""Field rules for artifact records: limits, grammar, kind policy and scope matching.

Every artifact-authoring surface -- the store, the dashboard handlers and the MCP
tools -- decides these questions through the functions here, so they cannot drift
apart: which strings are slugs, what a tag or name may hold, which kind a body is,
which kinds a person may pick, whether iframe content hardcodes its palette, what
counts as a document, and whether a session touched an artifact. Validators raise

#: be written as tags. Enclosing marks (``Me``) are NOT admitted: they draw a
#: shape around their base -- the keycap that turns ``1`` into an emoji, the
#: enclosing circle -- so they are symbols by another route. Other numbers
#: (``No``: ``½``, ``²``, ``①``, the numerals of scripts that do not count in
#: decimal digits) are not admitted either: they are symbols drawn from a digit,
#: not digits, and the ones with a plain digit spelling are compatibility forms
#: of it (refused below with that spelling named). Everything else is

#: NIKHAHIT + SARA AA, yet the composed form is the letter every Thai and Lao
#: keyboard types (``น้ำ``, water, is written with U+0E33). They are the only
#: tag-admissible letters whose ``<compat>`` decomposition opens with a combining
#: mark -- a letter with an inherent mark, not a presentation variant of other
#: letters -- and ``test_thai_and_lao_am_are_letters_not_compatibility_forms``

#: break "always visible, one spelling": ``ops`` and ``ops<VS16>`` would be two
#: stored tags with one look, and a key id with an invisible mark inside it would

#: changes nothing; a later Unicode version can still add a range, so refresh

def _strip_session_scope(key: str) -> str:
    """Canonicalize a session key so both spellings of ONE conversation match.

    The store's two provenance fields disagree by construction, and neither is
    wrong on its own:

    * ``Artifact.session_key`` is written from the dashboard's BARE slot key —
      ``chat-7-1785396512`` for a dashboard-born tab, ``slack_1785370133.085469``
      for a channel-born one — on the browser create path.
    * an event's ``session_id`` comes from the caller's FULL session key —
      ``dashboard:chat-7-1785396512``, or the channel's own
      ``slack:1785370133.085469`` — because MCP callers resolve identity through
      ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` / the signed pid sidecar, which are
      scope-qualified.

    A literal comparison therefore matches the origin case and *never* the event
    case — the involvement scope would silently degrade to the plain origin
    filter it exists to widen. Each family needs the fold that turns its session
    key into its slot name, because the slot name is what the origin field
    holds:

    * a dashboard slot's name is its session key minus the ``dashboard:`` scope.
    * a channel-born slot's name is its session key run through
      ``history._safe_key`` (see ``channel_slots.channel_slot_name``) — the same
      fold that names the transcript, which is why the tab and the thread share
      one file.

    The namespace itself is never dropped: ``slack:X`` canonicalizes to
    ``slack_X``, never to ``X``, so a channel conversation cannot collide with a
    dashboard slot. Keys with no second spelling to reconcile (``cron:``,
    ``subagent:``, ``taskrunner:``) are returned untouched.

    Both channel helpers are imported lazily because each one leads back to the
    artifact facade: ``kiro_crew.history`` and the ``kiro_crew.messaging``
    package (``messaging.driver`` -> ``acp`` -> ... -> ``members``) both import
    ``kiro_crew.artifacts``, which imports this module. A module-scope import here
    would re-enter the half-initialised facade and fail with an ImportError.

    each lifecycle event (``created`` / ``edited`` / ``iterated`` /
    ``referenced`` / ``reverted``). That union is what makes the in-session
    Artifacts tab able to list what a session *consumed*, not only what it
    authored — a read records a ``referenced`` event and an agent edit records
    an ``iterated`` one, so both surface here without a second index.

    Both sides are compared scope-normalized (see ``_strip_session_scope``)
    because the two fields are persisted in different formats.

    Note the event log is FIFO-capped at ``MAX_EVENTS_PER_ARTIFACT``, so a
    very old association on a heavily-edited artifact can age out. That is
