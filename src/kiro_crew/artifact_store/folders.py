        * **False (safe, default)** — delete only this folder; re-parent its
          direct child folders and artifacts to this folder's parent (root if
          none). Descendant folders travel up with their re-parented parent.
        * **True (cascade)** — permanently delete the whole subtree: every
          descendant artifact (via the guarded :meth:`ArtifactStore.delete`)
          and every descendant folder.

        ``destroyable_generations`` maps the slug of each artifact the caller has made
        safe to destroy to that artifact's ``created_at``. A descendant whose slug is
        absent is left in place and reported under ``unguarded_artifact_slugs``; one whose
        slug is present but whose stamp differs is a REPLACEMENT and is left in place and
        reported under ``replaced_artifact_slugs``. It defaults to EMPTY rather than to
        everything, so a cascade whose caller forgot to name its victims empties nothing
        and says which artifacts it left, instead of destroying a subtree nobody vouched
        for. Unread when ``delete_contents`` is false, which destroys no artifact at all.

        A slug is not an identity, which is why the stamp travels with it: the caller draws
        this map up before withdrawing published copies, that withdrawal awaits the
        network per copy, and a freed slug is re-minted identically. So an artifact the
        caller named can be deleted and a same-titled newcomer can take the name while the
        pass runs, and a slug-only map would match the newcomer and destroy it with no
        undo -- reported as an ordinary deletion, indistinguishable from the intended
        victim.

        The caller holding each listed artifact's publication guard is what makes the
        map meaningful: a first publish uploads its object before writing the
        record naming it, so ``refuse_if_published`` below cannot see one that is
        in flight, and an artifact filed into this subtree after the caller drew
        up its list is exactly the artifact whose publish this store cannot
        observe. Leaving it alone costs a folder that does not fully empty, which
        the owner deletes again; destroying it can strand a world-readable copy
        whose only handle goes with it.

        # On the CASCADE path it is NOT harmless, because the consequence is

        # published copy in the subtree before calling here and clears each
        # record it withdrew, so an artifact still holding a publication at this
        # point is exactly one that arrived after that preflight -- its copy was
