"""Read a chat's folder-inherited steering directories into prompt documents.

A sidebar folder may declare extra steering roots (``steering_dirs``) that every
chat under it inherits. This module is the ONE reader for them: the
Context_Builder calls it on the non-member session-start path and on the member
essentials path, so a single admissibility check, a single inclusion rule, a
single dedup and a single double-load skip serve both. A second reader would be
a second set of those rules, which is how one of them silently diverges.

The module is pure with respect to the process -- no dashboard state, no clock,
and the ONE config read is :func:`memory_silo_roots`, which asks the config
where the memory workspaces live so the fence follows the same answer the
memory layer does -- which is what lets the same call serve both paths and be
property-tested over real temporary trees.

    the ``**`` walk follows directory symlinks, so one link back up the tree or
    into a huge directory turns a small steering root into an unbounded
    enumeration. Deliberately not ``os.walk`` either: it builds one directory's
    complete name lists before yielding, so a single sufficiently wide
    directory is materialized whole before any ceiling can apply. This walker
    reads directory entries one at a time through ``os.scandir`` and counts
    each as it is read, so the ``_MAX_FOLDER_STEERING_ENTRIES`` ceiling bounds
    memory as well as work however wide or deep the tree behind the root is.
    It never descends a linked directory.

    The root is opened THROUGH A PINNED HANDLE (:func:`open_dir_pinned`: the
    parent chain resolved once and pinned component by component, the root's
    own name opened relative to it with ``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW``) and every
    subdirectory relative to its parent's descriptor. Validation screened the
    root's spelling, but ``is_dir()``/``scandir(path)`` would re-open that name
    and follow whatever sits there now -- on Windows a swap to a link at a
    share is itself the outbound SMB probe. Nothing in the subtree is addressed
    by path again; only the *logical* path is carried for the reader, which
    pins its own descriptor inside the root.

    Where a directory cannot be opened relative to a descriptor (Windows), the
    walk REFUSES rather than falling back to names: a by-name walk is not a
    weaker mode of this one, it is the mechanism whose check-then-open window
    the product's own modeled adversary -- an agent running as this user --
    can win by swapping an ancestor for a junction (see :mod:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs`
    and the same rule in :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot`). Folder steering is
    task guidance, so the refusal costs the turn nothing but that guidance,
    logged once at warning so an operator on such a host knows why.

    Order is deterministic: files of a directory (sorted), then its
    subdirectories (sorted, depth-first). Sorting needs a directory's names in
    hand, so a directory that cannot be listed within the remaining budget
    contributes nothing and ends the walk -- failing closed rather than
    emitting an order-dependent partial listing. Errors on a directory are
    skipped, not raised, so one unreadable subtree does not break a turn.

    When the entry ceiling ends the walk, the caller's *omissions* (if given)
    receives one :class:`SteeringOmission` of kind ``"entries"`` counting the
    directories still queued -- the part of the tree nobody listed -- so the

    Roots are read in the order given (the resolver hands them over root-first)
    and each document is emitted at most once across all of them, keyed by
    realpath. A missing root and an unreadable document are debug-logged and
    skipped so one stale path never breaks a turn.

    Two ceilings bound the pass -- ``_MAX_FOLDER_STEERING_DOCUMENTS`` on what is
    READ and ``_MAX_FOLDER_STEERING_ENTRIES`` on what is ENUMERATED per root --
    and each one that fires is COUNTED into ``omissions`` rather than dropped
    silently: past the document ceiling the remaining candidates are still
    enumerated (never opened, never read; the entry ceiling still bounds that
    enumeration) so their number is known per root. The renderer says the
    counts out loud once, so a capped tree never reads like a complete one.

    *skip_delivered_roots* says whether documents under the project's and the
    operator's ``.kiro/steering`` trees are ALREADY reaching the model by the
    provider's own steering path (kiro-cli loads them natively, the Claude Code
    seam loads them explicitly, KAS reports ``native_steering``) and so must not
    be re-sent here. A provider with no such path -- Codex, and the other
    harnesses that neither load ``.kiro/steering`` nor receive the explicit
    load -- passes ``False`` and receives them through the folder like any other
    document; skipping there would drop the rules with nothing delivered in
    their place. The default keeps the dedup for callers that know their
    provider delivers.

    *home* exists for the tests and for a caller that knows the operator home
    without paying ``Path.home()``; it defaults to ``Path.home()``.
