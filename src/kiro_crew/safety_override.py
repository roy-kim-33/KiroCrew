"""Time-limited safety override — replaces permanent YOLO mode.

Provides a ``SafetyOverride`` class with two kinds of grant:

- **Ad-hoc** — YOLO toggled mid-session from Slack, the dashboard picker or the
  API. Bounded by ONE duration shared by every surface (``agent.yolo_duration``,
  default 6 h, hard ceiling 24 h) and automatically expires. A 5-minute grace
  window after expiry allows renew() to reactivate without a full
  re-activation flow.
- **Declared** — ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions: true`` in operator-owned
  config (the camelCase and legacy ``yolo`` spellings are also read). A standing
  instruction, so it does NOT expire: it is re-established and re-audited on
  every startup (state is in-memory), cleared the moment the operator picks
  another approval mode, and deniable by the enterprise governance ceiling via
  the ``yolo_duration`` scope's ``permanent`` member — which downgrades it to the
  ad-hoc duration.

Per-surface TTLs (30 min Slack / 6 h dashboard / 24 h config) were removed: the
same operator re-enabling the same grant got a different lifetime depending on
where they clicked, which was unpredictable without buying any security.

All state changes are logged to the Security Event Log (SEL).

# So the file below records that a grant WAS live, never that it may resume. It
# holds the wall-clock deadline (the in-memory deadlines are
# ``time.monotonic()``, which means nothing to another process), the source, and
# whether the grant had an expiry at all. Startup reads it once, tells the
# operator when a TIMED grant still had time left, and deletes it.
#
# It is deliberately NOT signed, and that follows from what it can do: the file
# confers no authority, so the worst a forged one achieves is a spurious "your
# override was dropped" notice. A restored GRANT would need signing -- and a
# planned-vs-crash discriminator this codebase does not have -- which is exactly
# why restoring one is not what this does.
#
# One record per data home is correct, not a shared-state hazard: the file lives
# in ``config_dir()``, which is the very directory ``gateway_lock`` holds an
# exclusive advisory flock on for a gateway's whole lifetime, and a second
# gateway on the same home is REFUSED at startup rather than allowed to race
# (see gateway_lock's module docstring -- the invariant exists because shared-home
# writers clobber ``sessions/*.jsonl``). So there is never a sibling gateway to
# consume this record out from under the one that wrote it.
