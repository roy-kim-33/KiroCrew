"""Durable provenance for the ``settings.local.json`` seed Crew writes.

Crew seeds ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json`` for a claude-agent-acp
session and overwrites or removes ONLY the file it owns. Proving that ownership
from per-instance memory alone ("this client created it" plus "the bytes it
wrote") answers the question correctly inside one session and wrongly outside
one: a seed left behind by a session that was killed, or by an earlier app
version, reads as a stranger's file forever after. The writer then
takes its leave-it-alone branch on every subsequent session, so a stale
``availableModels`` allowlist (and a stale ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an
inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes permanent project state that Crew can
neither refresh nor clean up.

This module is the missing half: a small record, under Crew's OWN data home, of
the bytes Crew last wrote to a given settings path. It is a **provenance
credential, not a permission grant** — a record alone proves nothing, because
adoption additionally requires the file on disk to still hash to the recorded
digest. A user-authored file (or a Crew file the user has since edited) never
matches, so it is still left untouched; only Crew's own orphan is recognized and
re-seeded.

Four properties the callers depend on:

* **Nothing is added to the user's project.** The record lives beside Crew's
  other sidecars in ``config_dir()``, keyed by the settings path, so a checked-out
  repository gains no extra file to notice, ignore or commit.
* **Lookups never touch the disk, and no mutation runs on the event loop.**
  Ownership is consulted synchronously from teardown, so the sidecar is read once
  at import and served from memory afterwards. Durable mutations write and are
  therefore blocking; each runs off-loop. :func:`release_local` and
  :func:`unshare_local` are the memory-only counterparts teardown may call
  directly after the off-loop discard handles durable holder withdrawal.
* **Every failure answers "not ours".** An unreadable or corrupt sidecar, a
  missing entry, a malformed entry — all degrade to the pre-existing behaviour of
  leaving the file alone, which is the safe direction.
* **A record is adoptable only once nobody here still holds it.** Ownership is
  scoped to an owner token, so an orphan is adopted by the next session while a
  path a LIVE client in this process is seeding stays that client's own.

The sharer registry (:func:`share` / :func:`unshare` / :func:`has_sharers`)
interleaves with the owner lifecycle in ``acp/client.py``; these are the
invariants both modules hold together, each backed by a review ruling on the
PR that introduced it:

* **Byte-equality is the share boundary.** A session becomes a sharer only
  when the payload it would write is byte-identical to the file on disk.
* **Only the owner writes.** A sharer never writes, claims, or deletes the
  settings file. The durable :func:`record` commit refuses a digest change while
  any live sharer protects the prior record; client-side sharer probes are early
  exits, not the barrier.
* **A lease is withdrawn only by its own sharer's reset** — or by promotion
  to ownership, the single authorship point.
* **A record a live sharer validated survives every prune** until that
  sharer's reset (:func:`_persist` exempts keys with live sharers).
* **Records are invisible until durable.** :func:`record` publishes in memory
  only after its persist lands, so a rider never trusts bytes whose grant
  could vanish in a crash.
* **Owner teardown keeps the file under live sharers** and hands back only
  its own slot; the next session adopts and repairs the recorded orphan.

# it is non-empty, the owner's teardown leaves the file in place (see the
# client's settle transaction), :func:`claim` refuses a new adoption, and
# :func:`_persist` refuses a digest-changing record, so no Crew session can put
# DIFFERENT permission bytes at a path a sharer already delivered tools against.
# Like ``_LIVE`` it is the in-process cache: each

# too, and a holder whose process is gone reads as stale and reclaimable.
