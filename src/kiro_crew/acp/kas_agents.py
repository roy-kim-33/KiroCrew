"""Project a Crew agent spec onto KAS's ``ClientCustomAgent`` shape.

kiro-cli reads agent definitions from ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and selects one
with a ``--agent`` flag. KAS has no such flag: it advertises only its own
built-in modes and takes client agents over the wire, as
``_meta.kiro.customAgents`` on ``session/new``. Each injected agent is
registered and then surfaces as a switchable mode, which is what lets the
ordinary ``session/set_mode`` activation work afterwards.

Two properties of KAS's schema drive the mapping and are easy to get wrong:

* ``prompt`` must be resolved content. A ``file://`` URI is the client's job to
  read, so a spec that points at a prompt file has to be inlined here.
* ``tools`` absent means NO tool access, not "all tools" — KAS resolves it as
  ``agent.tools ?? []``. The list is therefore always emitted explicitly, and an
  ambiguous spec fails closed rather than guessing ``*``.

``mcpServers`` IS projected, minus the names that arrive as session-level broker
stubs. ``@server`` entries in ``tools`` do resolve wherever the server was
declared, so carrying the servers twice would risk a double registration — but
that only arises for a STUBBED server, and stubs are opt-in per server
(``mcp_gateway.stub_servers``, empty by default). With nothing stubbed the
session-level param is an empty array, so omitting the block leaves a KAS session
holding ``tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]`` and no definition of what
``kirocrew-core`` is — refs naming nothing, and every Crew tool silently absent.
kiro-cli does not have this problem: it reads the spec off disk itself via
``--agent``.

Filtering by the stub set keeps the no-double-registration guarantee (a stubbed
server is still declared exactly once, by the injection that outranks this block)
while never leaving the session with nothing. Two fields are dropped on the way
through, and a muted or registry-governed entry is not declared at all — see
:func:`_project_mcp_servers`. The runtime then carries the ACTIVE
agent's projected managed entries in the session-level array itself
(:func:`hoist_managed_servers`), the declaration site the captured 2.18.0 release
honours over a same-named global or workspace server and every probed release
reports as the session's own.

``model`` is deliberately NOT projected: the model is set through its own
protocol verb, so it has exactly one owner rather than being pinned in two places
that can disagree.

``welcomeMessage`` IS projected, through the same
:func:`kiro_crew.agent_discovery.spec_welcome_message` reading the dashboard
renders. One reader, so the hint a KAS session registers and the hint Crew shows
cannot disagree -- and the cap and whitespace rules that reading already applies
to this user-writable field are not re-argued for a second path onto the wire.

``permissions`` IS projected, and is the one field that changes behaviour rather
than just describing it. KAS's policy is keyed by its own capability vocabulary
instead of by tool name, so it is not a rename of Crew's ``allowedTools`` — see
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_permissions` for the mapping and for why an entry it
cannot classify is left to prompt. Omitting the field is not the neutral choice
it looks like: with no policy, KAS resolves every request to ``ask``, so a spec
that auto-approves a dozen tools on kiro-cli would prompt for all of them here.
The derived rules come from ``allowedTools`` and nothing else, and a
``permissions`` block the spec's author wrote is then intersected with the same
ceiling and appended -- see :func:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_permissions.merge_user_permissions`
for the four rules. Dropping the author's block entirely would leave a pure-KAS
agent -- ``permissions`` authored, no ``allowedTools`` -- reaching the backend with
the field absent, which is the all-``ask`` case above.

    Five subtractions, each load-bearing:

    * **stubbed names** — those arrive as the session-level ``mcpServers`` param,
      which outranks an agent-declared entry. Emitting both is the double
      registration this block exists to avoid. Applied LAST: the withholds below
      are decisions about whether the server may run at all, and a name handed to
      the injection escapes every one of them.
    * **``autoApprove``** — an auto-approved MCP tool is approved by the host and
      emits no permission request, so ``hooks.on_tool_call`` (the always-on deny
      floor, the sensitive-path check, the governance ceiling) never runs for it.
      ``agent.py`` states the rule for Crew's own servers ("DELIBERATELY NO
      ``autoApprove`` KEY, and none may ever be added"); relaying one copied from
      a spec would grant through this path what that rule refuses on the other,
      and on KAS there is no wire slot for hooks at all. Auto-approve reaches KAS
      only as ``permissions``, derived from the ceiling-filtered ``allowedTools``.
    * **``env`` and ``headers``** — projection puts these on the wire, and a
      declared server's env routinely holds tokens. Every server is filtered; the
      classes differ only in what survives. A server Crew did not author loses
      both fields outright. One of Crew's OWN managed servers keeps exactly
      ``KIROCREW_HOME`` out of its env and nothing else, because that key is the
      only reason managed env is projected at all: without it the shims read a
      different data home than the gateway. A managed entry still lives in a
      user-editable agent file, so a hand-added key under a managed name is
      withheld like any other.

    * **a muted server** — an entry carrying ``disabled: true`` is not declared at
      all. KAS's wire schema accepts the field and its mapper then drops it
      (:data:`_KAS_DISCARDED_ENTRY_KEYS`), so projecting a muted entry launches
      the very server the user silenced. Omitting the declaration is the only
      Crew-side way to say "do not launch this" that the backend cannot discard,
      and it says the same thing: a server KAS was never told about does not run.
      The mute is the user's own decision about a server they can un-mute, so
      honouring it costs no capability — unlike the credential strip above, it has
      no residue.
    * **a registry-governed entry** — see :func:`_registry_governed`. The filter
      mirrors kiro-cli's, which is SYMMETRIC: in registry mode an entry survives
      only by resolving its ``"type": "registry"`` marker against the admin's
      catalog, and OUTSIDE registry mode a marked entry is the one that is
      dropped. So a non-managed entry is withheld when registry mode is on
      (marked or not) and also when it is marked while the mode is off. Both
      cases are ones KAS would get wrong rather than merely differently: it has no
      slot for ``type``, so it sees every entry as unmarked — dropping all of them
      under an admin's catalog, and mounting a marked one outside it that kiro-cli
      would have dropped. Withholding here makes the first case diagnosable and
      the second correct.

    Crew's OWN managed servers are exempt from that filter and keep their marker,
    which is the same exemption :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp` makes for the
    control plane and for the same reason: they are the host's own processes, and
    a session that loses them cannot report back to its channel at all. On today's
    KAS the marker does not reach the registry filter, so under registry mode the
    host drops them anyway and the session comes up with no Crew tools — which is
    why that case is WARNED about once rather than left silent, and why the
    exemption is still right: the day the wire carries ``type``, a governed
    session keeps its control plane with no further change here.

    A non-managed server therefore starts without its credentials and may fail to
    authenticate — which is still strictly better than today, where it does not
    start at all. The drop is logged with KEY NAMES ONLY so an operator can see
    why, without the value reaching a log.

    Note what this canNOT reach: ``command``, ``args`` and ``url`` are how the
    server is launched or addressed, so a secret embedded THERE (an ``--api-key``
    argv, a signed query string) still crosses the wire. Stripping them would not
    withhold a credential, it would unmake the server — the exact "declared but
    absent" state this function exists to end — so the residue is accepted and
    stated rather than papered over.

    """Read a materialized agent spec.

    Takes the directory explicitly rather than resolving it here so this module
    stays free of :mod:`kiro_crew.agent`, which imports the config loader and
    would form an import cycle.

    A spec that DECLARES ``name == agent_id`` wins, found through
    :func:`kiro_crew.agent_discovery.spec_by_declared_name`, and
    ``<agent_id>.json`` or ``<agent_id>.md`` (the markdown form, frontmatter
    plus a body that is the prompt -- see :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_spec_format`)
    is read only when no spec declares the id. That is the
    order :func:`kiro_crew.agent.agent_spec_path` and the documented resolution
    convention use, and it is what keeps a misnamed ``<agent_id>.json`` that
    declares some other agent from being projected under this id, with that
    other agent's tools and prompt, while the spec that does declare the id
    sits beside it unread. Two specs declaring *agent_id* are refused, as
    :func:`kiro_crew.agent.agent_spec_path` refuses them: which is live is
    undefined, and picking either would project an agent the operator did not
    name.

    The scan's parsed spec is what the projection uses: it was read under the hardened
    reader's guards, labelled ``kas_agent_projection`` so a denial is
    attributed to the projection, and reopening the file it came from would
    read it a second time with none of them. The fallback read of
    ``<agent_id>.json`` (or ``.md``) goes through
    :func:`kiro_crew.agent_discovery.read_agent_spec_strict`, the same guards
    with the failure class kept; a spec declaring no name at all, or a name
    other than its stem, reaches the projection only through it.

    A resolved scan answer is served from :data:`_SPEC_SCAN_MEMO`, the
    directory-revision memo, while the directory is unchanged: every KAS
    session start otherwise hardened-reads every spec in the directory to
    find one. That keeps the freshness contract above, because the revision
    is a ``stat`` of the directory and of every spec entry in it, taken
    before and after the read -- an edit changes it, and a directory
    containing a symlinked spec, or one written inside the racy window, is
    never memoized (:func:`kiro_crew.agent_discovery.agents_dir_revision`,
    which also refuses a spec entry whose kind cannot be read and a directory
    past its entry cap). The answer handed
    back is a deep copy, so it is still a parse the caller owns and a caller's
    mutation cannot reach a later session. The fallback read below is one file
    and is not memoized.

    The scan and the fallback read raise :class:`KasAgentTranslationError` on
    an ``OSError`` for the same reason: every caller of this module handles the
    translation error, not an ``OSError``. On 3.12 ``Path.glob`` propagates one
    from the ``is_dir`` probe it runs on the directory itself (3.13 and 3.14
    run no such probe), and the strict reader raises one for a file it cannot
    resolve or open on every supported version, so an unsearchable agents dir
    reaches this function as an ``OSError`` and the conversion is what makes
    the failure uniform. Neither exception leaves anything in the memo.

    One entry: KAS registers the injected agent, it then surfaces as a mode, and
    the ordinary ``session/set_mode`` activation can select it. Without this the
    session stays on KAS's own default mode and the operator's prompt and tool
    configuration have no effect.

    A prompt-less spec (e.g. ``kirocrew-lite``) is projected with the small
    :data:`_KAS_FALLBACK_PROMPT` so it satisfies KAS's non-empty-prompt
    requirement instead of crashing the session (see :func:`resolve_prompt`).

    *stub_server_names* is forwarded to :func:`_project_mcp_servers`; the caller
    holds the gateway overlay this session will inject from, so it is the only
    layer that can answer which names are stubbed.

    *spec* is REQUIRED and positional, and this function performs no read of its
    own. Its answer becomes the session's whole tool surface, so it has to be
    built from the spec the caller verified under the freshness gate -- reading the
    file here would be a SECOND read, milliseconds later, and a revocation landing
    in between would be projected as though it had been checked. A defaulted
    parameter that fell back to :func:`load_agent_spec` would restore exactly that
    hole for any caller that forgot to pass one, which is why there is no default.
    *agents_dir* stays for :func:`resolve_prompt`, which anchors a ``file://``
    prompt URI and reads a different artifact than the spec.

    Captured released kiro-cli 2.18.0 honours a session-level ``mcpServers``
    entry over a same-named global or workspace ``mcp.json`` server on
    ``session/new`` and ``session/load`` alike, while an agent-block declaration
    loses to the global one there, and it stamps no status provenance. The
    retained 2.20.0 capture proves a session-level injection reports
    ``origin: client`` and reaches readiness; its same-name collision behaviour
    was not probed. The session-level array is therefore the one declaration site
    whose connected report is positively the session's own on both, and Crew's
    managed servers -- the ones whose env carries this session's key -- belong
    there rather than in the block, exactly as the member dispatch server already
    travels.

    Pure and non-mutating: returns a new agents list (the active descriptor
    shallow-copied with the hoisted names removed from ``mcpServers``) and a new
    array (the caller's entries first, then the hoisted elements by name). The
    entries hoisted are the ALREADY projected ones -- credential fields withheld,
    ``autoApprove`` dropped, ``KIROCREW_PORT``/``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` applied
    -- so no spec is re-read and the source snapshot is untouched.

    What is NOT hoisted, each deliberately:

    * a name the caller's array already carries -- a broker stub or the member
      dispatch entry is authoritative and a name must appear once;
    * a non-managed server -- third-party declarations are not this seam's;
    * an inactive agent's block -- it must not widen the active session's tool
      surface or carry another identity's key;
    * an entry with a key outside :data:`_HOISTABLE_ENTRY_KEYS`, a ``type``
      other than ``stdio``, or no usable command -- a restriction, a registry
      marker or a malformed entry keeps the block path, where it is honoured.

    The agent's ``tools`` / ``excludedTools`` / ``permissions`` are untouched:
    ``@server`` refs resolve wherever the server was declared, which is the same
    property ``member_dispatch`` already relies on for ``@kirocrew-dashboard``.
