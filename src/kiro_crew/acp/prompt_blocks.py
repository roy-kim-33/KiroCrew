"""Build ACP ``session/prompt`` content blocks from a plain message string.

Channels hand the provider ONE string. When that string contains an absolute
path to a readable image, the image must travel as a real ACP image block --
a bare path is just text, and the model cannot see it. This module owns that
conversion so both prompt paths share one implementation:

* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle.AcpSessionHandle.prompt` -- the live path
  for the public Kiro backend (``AcpProvider.start`` swaps ``AcpClient`` out for
  ``AcpSessionProvider``, so this is what actually reaches kiro-cli).
* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient._send_prompt` -- the direct-client path.

Keeping one builder matters: both paths need the same path-to-image
conversion, so a single implementation stops any channel from shipping a
filesystem path to the model as text.

Wire shape (per docs/reference/kiro-cli/acp.md):

#    final ".png" -- not a file, so every image in a multi-image message was
#    dropped.
#
# 2. The character class holds HORIZONTAL whitespace only, and a lookbehind
#    forbids starting inside a URL or another path. With `\s` (which includes
#    "\n") a leading URL chained across the newline into the appended path:
#    `slack/events.py` emits "<user text>\n<image path>", so
#
#        see https://example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png
#
#    matched as "//example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png" -- one nonexistent path. Any
#    Slack message containing a link therefore lost its image. The `(?<![\w:/])`
#    guard rejects the "/" inside "https://" as a start position, which also
