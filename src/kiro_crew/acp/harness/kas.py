"""The KAS relay, reached through kiro-cli's own ACP transport.

KAS shares kiro-cli's binary, but reports MCP readiness through session-scoped
``_kiro/mcp/status`` and ``_kiro/tools/didChange`` snapshots.

It takes no ``--agent`` flag, so the agent definition travels on every session
start and has to be re-sent on resume. Its ``protocolVersion`` is an integer, not
a date string. It can ask Crew for the access token instead of holding one. And
its teardown verb DESTROYS the session record rather than evicting it.
