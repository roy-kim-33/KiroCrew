"""Seams every harness answers the same way, and the kiro-family vocabulary.

Two kinds of thing live here.

:class:`MembershipHarness` implements the seams whose answer is a LOOKUP rather
than a judgement -- sandbox delegation, pod HOME remapping, recycle thresholds.
Each is one read of a membership set keyed by the harness's own backend id, so a
subclass gets the right answer by declaring its id and nothing else. This is what
keeps the promise that the harness layer re-declares no membership: there is
exactly one implementation of each of these questions in the tree, and it reads
the set that already owns the answer.

A lookup only earns a member here when a CALLER asks the harness for it. Routing
and the model verb are looked up by both drivers straight from their tables, so
mirroring them would add a second declaration rather than remove one.

:data:`KIRO_FAMILY_ALIASES` is the ``_kiro.dev/*`` notification vocabulary that
kiro-cli and the KAS relay both speak, because KAS is reached THROUGH kiro-cli's
own ACP relay. A host outside that family declares its own.
