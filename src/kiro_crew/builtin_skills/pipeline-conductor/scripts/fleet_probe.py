"""Batch fleet probe — the deterministic half of the pipeline conductor's patrol.

One invocation answers, for every watched worker session, "does anything need
judgment this cycle?" — plus host posture — so a quiet patrol cycle costs one
script call and a couple of output lines instead of N transcript reads.

Usage:
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json>
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json> --mark-handled KEY TAG DIGEST

Config (JSON):
    {
      "sessions": ["dashboard_chat-601-1788099254", ...],   # slot keys to watch
      "idle_alert_secs": 900,      # silent longer than this -> IDLE alert
      "tail_bytes": 200000,        # per-session transcript PARSE cap
      "load_alert_per_cpu": 1.5,   # 1-min loadavg / cpu above this -> hot
      "err_res": [...],            # extra error-tail regexes (optional)
      "banned_process_res": [...], # cmdline regexes for banned ops (optional)
      "init_timeout_res": [...],   # initialize-timeout tails (optional)
      "watchdog_res": [...],       # turn-ended-by-stall-watchdog tails (optional)
      "fleet_worktrees": [...],    # absolute roots this fleet owns (optional)
      "argv_runner_detection": true # false switches OFF the argv-side runner shape
    }

Every regex key is validated at load time: a bad pattern is malformed config
(exit 2 with the offending pattern), never a crash mid-cycle. ``tail_bytes``
caps how much of a transcript is PARSED, not how much is read -- the whole file
is read either way, which is what makes the tail index monotonic for free.

Paths are DERIVED, never configurable -- the same containment rule for every
location this script touches, because its config is authored by a no-write
agent and a config-chosen path would quietly widen what an approved run can
reach:

  * transcripts are read from ``<data home>/sessions`` only, where the data
    home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` (else ``~/.kiro/crew``) -- the gateway this
    conductor belongs to, not an arbitrary directory;
  * the handled-set state file is ALWAYS ``<config path>.state.json``;
  * the banned-process scan reads ``/proc`` (``$KIROCREW_PROBE_PROC_ROOT``
    exists for the test harness).

A session key that does not match a transcript stem directly is also tried as
``dashboard_<key>`` (and with ``:`` as ``_``): ``session_create`` answers slot
keys while the store prefixes the surface, and a raw key must not read as a
missing session -- GONE triggers reclaim, and a false GONE is how an active
item gets duplicate-dispatched.

The data home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` when set, else ``~/.kiro/crew`` — the same
resolution every pipeline script uses.

Output (text, one line per FIRING signal; suppressed sessions print nothing):
    🔔 <session-key> <age>s <TAG> i=<index> d=<digest>

``i=`` counts the rows that SESSION PRODUCED -- its own messages and tool calls,
never an inbound nudge, inject or user row, because a supervisor's own nudge
landing in the file must not read as the worker making progress. It is a
monotonic per-session position counted from the start of the file, not from the
window, so it cannot saturate once a transcript passes ``tail_bytes``. An
unchanged count since the conductor last acted is *no progress*, whether or not
a turn is open, and that is the discriminator a self-deadlocked worker cannot
fake -- the probe makes that comparison itself and fires ``NOPROGRESS`` rather
than leaving two numbers for someone to diff. It is a position, so it carries no
transcript content.

Metadata only, by design: transcript-derived text never appears in the output,
so no private session content crosses into the caller's context whatever keys
the config watches. Content, when a ruling needs it, is read through the
workspace-authorized session tools.
    BANNED pid=<pid> rule=<regex|argv:<shape>> cwd=fleet|unknown age=<secs|?>s
       scope=suite|paths|unknown cmd=<program,flags,+withheld>
    OK <n> watched, <m> fired | load/cpu <x> (<posture>) | mem <G>G
       | banned <k> | foreign <k> | deliver init-timeout <a>, watchdog <b>

``banned`` counts fleet-owned matches only -- a banned command shape running in
an unrelated checkout on the same host is somebody else's business, and counting
it made the conductor stop a worker that was not the offender. Those are
summarised as ``foreign`` and not printed. ``deliver`` is the honest admission
instrument: load and memory can both read healthy while the fleet cannot
deliver, so sessions whose tail carries an initialize timeout or a
stall-watchdog turn end are counted every cycle, fired or not.

Tags: the worker protocol words (``WORKING/PR/GREEN/BLOCKED/STANDDOWN/
PROPOSAL``) -- recognised in their protocol form, ``<WORD>:``, so prose that
merely opens with one is not a report -- plus ``ERR`` for an error/throttle
tail, ``IDLE`` for silence past the threshold, ``TERMINAL`` for a session whose
last dispositioned report ENDED its assignment (``GREEN``/``STANDDOWN``/
``PROPOSAL``) and which has since written unprefixed text, ``NOPROGRESS`` for a
session that has produced nothing since the conductor last acted on it, and
``-`` when a tail carries no tag
(never fires on its own). Tool rows never classify: a protocol word or an error
phrase inside a tool card is quoted text, not a report.

The tag is the newest REPORT, not the newest message, because ``BLOCKED`` is
STICKY: a probe samples rather than subscribes, and the protocol requires a
blocked worker to keep reporting status, so its own next message would displace
the only thing a newest-message classifier reads. A heartbeat (``WORKING``) and
unprefixed text leave a sticky report standing; any other report supersedes it.
``TERMINAL`` and sticky ``BLOCKED`` are kept distinct on purpose -- one says
close me, the other says a ruling is owed.

Leading markdown decoration is stripped before the tag is matched, because the
match is anchored at position zero and ``**BLOCKED:**`` puts an asterisk there.
Emphasis, blockquote arrows, heading hashes and list markers all count. The
normalisation applies to the MATCHED text only: the digest is still computed over
what the worker wrote, and the anchor survives, so a bolded protocol word
mid-sentence is still not a report.

THE HANDLED SET replaces the overnight run's hand-grown ``grep -vE`` exclusion
pipe. Every fired line carries a ``d=<digest>`` field; ``--mark-handled KEY TAG
DIGEST`` records exactly that digest into the state file (compare-and-set: if
the tail moved on since the probe, the mark is REFUSED with exit 3 so the
caller re-probes instead of suppressing a payload nobody read). A signal is
then suppressed while (tag, digest) both still match. A new payload under the
same tag re-fires (a second GREEN with a new PR number is a new signal).
``IDLE`` marks expire after another ``idle_alert_secs``
so a nudged-but-still-silent worker re-alerts instead of vanishing.

A handled entry also records the tail ``index`` at the moment of the mark, and
the last dispositioned PAYLOAD report as ``settled`` (its tag AND digest) -- one
field, written on every mark and carried forward when the mark is not itself a
payload, so no later disposition can erase the fact that a report was already
answered. Neither field takes part in the digest, and a state file written before
they existed still suppresses exactly as it did; a legacy ``proto`` field, which
recorded only the tag, is still read so an in-place upgrade keeps its terminal
reading.

Deliberately boring properties, do not weaken:
  * No subprocess, ever. Reads transcripts, ``/proc`` and ``loadavg`` directly.
  * The only write is the probe's own state file, atomically, and only on
    ``--mark-handled``.
  * A per-session problem (unreadable file, malformed line) degrades that one
    row, never the cycle. Exit 0 when the probe ran; 2 on malformed config.

    fire either, so the report is not delayed or suppressed -- it is silent.

    That is worth normalising rather than legislating, because emphasis is

DEFAULT_ERR_RES = (

    r"dispatch failure",

)

#: Banned-operation cmdline shapes: a pytest whose worker pool BYPASSES the
#: budget, and a bare full-suite vitest with no file arguments.
#:
#: The axis is budgeted versus unbudgeted, not "did the caller write a number".
#: On THIS repo the explicit number is the one spelling that can outgrow the
#: host: ``setup.cfg`` documents that ``auto`` is bounded by the rootdir
#: conftest's ``pytest_xdist_auto_num_workers`` hook, which sizes the pool by
#: available memory and by what concurrent runs on the host already hold, and
#: that "an explicit ``-n <N>`` bypasses the budget" -- the hook is
#: ``firstresult`` and only ever answers ``auto``. The gate runner
#: (``scripts/run_scoped_tests.py::pytest_parallel_args``) therefore emits
#: ``-n auto`` and cannot pass a number, and the default ``addopts`` supply
#: ``-n auto`` to a pytest carrying no ``-n`` at all.
#:
#: So the rule flags a pytest whose EFFECTIVE worker count is an explicit number
#: of two or more, in any spelling -- ``-n 4``, ``-n=4``, ``-n4``, ``-n 32``,
#: ``--numprocesses=4``, ``--numprocesses 2`` -- and stays quiet on every
#: budgeted or single-process form: ``-n auto``, ``-n logical``,
#: ``--numprocesses auto``, a pytest with no ``-n`` (``addopts`` decide, and they
#: say ``auto``), and ``-n0`` / ``-n 1`` / ``-n=0`` / ``--numprocesses 1``, which
#: run one process with xdist inactive. ``-n0`` is the repo's own documented
#: override, so the form a worker is REQUIRED to use is a passing one. Where the
#: same flag is given twice the LAST one wins, as argparse resolves it, so
#: ``-n 4 -n auto`` ends up budgeted and is quiet -- that half is read from the
#: argv tokens (``_argv_worker_pool_is_budgeted``), since a joined command line
#: cannot express "the last one". The tokens settle two more things the joined
#: line cannot: pytest's ``--`` ends its options, so a ``-n0`` behind it is a
#: path and never the run's count; and ``-o addopts=...`` / ``--override-ini
#: addopts=...`` replace the ``addopts`` the run starts from, so their ``-n`` is
#: folded in AHEAD of the run's own tokens, exactly where pytest puts it.
#:
#: What the rule cannot read is the checkout: ``auto`` is budgeted by THIS tree's
#: conftest, and the probe already keys the stop on ``cwd=fleet`` for exactly
#: that reason. The cap decision reads argv and nothing else.
#:
#: The pytest rule matches an INVOCATION rather than a mention, and two guards are
#: what make that distinction; each one answers a false ``BANNED`` against a run
#: that IS budgeted.
#:
#: * The token has to be the runner's own name, optionally path-qualified
#:   (``pytest``, ``/x/.venv/bin/pytest``, ``-m pytest``). A filename that merely
#:   CONTAINS the word names no command, and a bare ``\bpytest\b`` cannot tell the
#:   two apart: ``.`` and ``-`` are non-word characters, so ``pytest.log``,
#:   ``pytest.ini``, ``.pytest_cache`` and ``pytest-cov`` all satisfy it. A worker's
#:   test step runs the capped pytest and then greps the log it wrote, which is
#:   exactly that shape. So the name must be a WHOLE shell token, sitting between two
#:   token boundaries: that covers the filename spellings above, the directory in
#:   ``/tmp/pytest/results.log``, and equally the packaging forms a character-by-
#:   character exclusion list keeps missing -- ``pytest:latest``, ``pytest==7.4.0``,
#:   ``pytest@1.2.3``.
#: * The worker count is read from the SAME command. One cmdline can carry a whole
#:   shell script in a single argument, where the unbudgeted run and a budgeted one
#:   are different lines, so the lookahead stops at a command separator (``;``,
#:   ``&``, ``|``, a newline) instead of scanning the rest of the script. Letting it
#:   span the whole script text is the opposite trade and a worse one: one line's
#:   ``-n 8`` would then condemn every budgeted run beside it.
#:
#:   A separator inside a BRACKETED or QUOTED span is not a command end, though, and
#:   this is where the argv matters: ``/proc`` hands over NUL-separated arguments that
#:   are joined for matching, so a metacharacter sitting inside ONE argument arrives in
#:   the scanned text with no shell involved. A parametrized node id does exactly that
#:   -- ``pytest f.py::t[a|b] -n 8`` is an unbudgeted run whose ``|`` would hide its
#:   own ``-n 8`` behind a barrier -- and the answer is a missed row on the one shape
#:   the counter exists to catch. So the scan crosses a bracketed or quoted span whole,
#:   and only a separator outside both ends the command. An UNQUOTED ``|`` stays a
#:   separator, because there it really is a pipe and the number after it belongs to
#:   the next command.
#:
#: The flag must start a token, so a target like ``test-n1.py`` cannot be read as
#: ``-n 1``. Zero and one are the single-process spellings and are not selected; any
#: other digit run is, and the argv reader has the last word on it -- ``-n 01`` is one
#: process there, and a value pytest would reject (``-n 4abc``) answers fail-closed.
#: Whitespace is spelled ``[\x20\t]`` rather than with a literal space because
#: ``rule=`` prints the pattern verbatim onto a line read as whitespace-separated
#: fields, and a pattern holding a space would split that one field into three.
#:
#: What the pair does NOT separate: a runner name standing alone as some other
#: program's argument (``grep -rn pytest src``) still matches. Telling that from a
#: launcher that really does run the runner (``poetry run pytest``, ``uv run
#: pytest``, an unknown wrapper) needs a list of every launcher rather than a
#: shape, and a list is what silently loses the launcher nobody added. So the
#: residual error stays on the reporting side, like the rest of this scan, and the
#: ``cmd=`` field on the line shows which program the match sat in.
#: What ends a shell TOKEN: whitespace or a metacharacter. The runner name has to sit
#: between two of these (or a string edge) to be a command rather than a fragment of a
#: longer word, and stating that positively is what keeps the rule from growing one
#: excluded character at a time -- a list of characters that continue a token has to
#: name ``.`` for ``pytest.log``, ``-`` for ``pytest-cov``, ``:`` for ``pytest:latest``,
#: ``=`` for ``pytest==7.4.0`` and ``@`` for ``pytest@1.2.3``, and the next packaging
#: spelling is another silent false stop. Spelled with escapes throughout because
#: ``rule=`` prints the pattern verbatim onto a line read as whitespace-separated
#: fields, so a literal space, quote or backtick in it would split or reopen that field.
_SHELL_TOKEN_BOUNDARY = r"[\s;&|<>()\x22\x27\x60]"

#: What the count search may cross on its way from the runner to the run's own ``-n``:
#: any character that is neither a command separator nor the OPENER of a span, plus a
#: bracketed or quoted span taken WHOLE, because a separator inside one of those is
#: data the command carries rather than the end of it. The openers are excluded from
#: the first branch to keep the alternation DISJOINT: leaving ``[``, ``\x27`` and
#: ``\x22`` in it gives every span two parses -- whole, or character by character --
#: so k spans admit 2**k of them. This star sits inside a lookahead that FAILS on
#: every budgeted run -- the ordinary, healthy case -- so the case that must walk
#: every parse is every worker's own ``-n auto`` rerun naming a few dozen
#: parametrized node ids, and there is no timeout or length bound in this script to
#: end the stall. The quotes are spelled ``\x22``/``\x27`` for the same reason the
#: boundary class is -- ``rule=`` prints the pattern verbatim onto a line read as
#: whitespace-separated fields.

    RUNNER's options, and a launcher in front of it has options of its own that can
    wear the same spelling. None means no runner token stands alone -- a wrapper, an
    unknown name, or a module flag glued to the runner -- and both callers answer
    conservatively rather than guessing from a position they could not find.

    A token that cannot be a program NAME is skipped before the question is asked at
    all, and that is load bearing rather than tidy. ``_token_base`` reduces a token to
    its last path component, so an option's or an assignment's VALUE reduces to one too:
    ``TMPDIR=/tmp/pytest-of-ci/pytest-3`` becomes ``pytest-3``, which the runner
    vocabulary admits. Answering with that position hands both callers the wrong span --
    the count reader then sees a LAUNCHER's ``-n 10`` as the run's own worker count and
    a budgeted run is reported, and the scope reader sees the runner's path as a target
    and calls a whole-suite run ``paths``. Every pytest temp directory is named after the
    runner, so the shape is ordinary rather than contrived.

    This also makes ``_is_runner_base``'s own precondition true: it is asked only about a

    A rule match says a run's worker count bypasses the budget; it says nothing
    about how much that run is doing, and those are wildly different severities. A
    whole-suite run is what reached the several-hundred-process fan-out and is the
    line to reach for first; a single-file run matching the same rule fans out over
    a few files and can wait its turn. Ranking only -- whether to respond at
    all stays keyed to ``cwd=fleet``, which this word never gates. Reported as ONE
    derived word so the readout stays judgeable without anyone opening ``ps``.

    Deliberately derived, never quoted. The caller documents why the argv is not
    echoed -- a command line can carry a credential or a presigned URL, and this
    text lands in the conductor's model context -- and a path is exactly the part
    that leaks a checkout layout. ``suite`` / ``paths`` / ``unknown`` carries the
    severity while being three fixed strings that can hold no argument content.

    Scanning starts AFTER the runner token because everything before it is the
    interpreter's own path: ``/usr/bin/python3`` contains a separator, so reading
    argv from index 0 would classify every POSIX invocation as path-scoped.

    **Deliberately approximate, and biased toward over-stating severity.** A bare
    token cannot be told from an option's VALUE without knowing which options take
    one, and this function cannot know that: ``--token secret test`` offers no way
    to see that ``secret`` is a value and ``test`` a target. So only an
    unmistakable target counts -- one carrying a separator, a ``.py`` suffix or a
    ``::`` node id -- and the two resulting misreads are not symmetrical:

    * ``pytest test`` (a bare directory, no separator) reads as ``suite``. That
      over-states severity, which is the fail-closed direction for a monitoring
      control and the same direction the wrapper exemption above chose.
    * Nothing reads as ``paths`` unless a real target shape is present, so the
      quiet answer is never the one produced by guessing.
    * ``pytest --pyargs kiro_crew.mod`` names an importable package, not a path,
      so it carries none of the three shapes and reads as ``suite`` -- narrowed in
      fact, over-stated in the readout, the same safe direction.

    Resolving a token against the filesystem would settle it and is refused on
    purpose: this walks OTHER processes' argv, each with its own cwd, so a probe
    that stat()s their arguments both lies about relative paths and turns a
    read-only monitor into something that touches attacker-influenced paths.

    The rule's pattern is matched against the space-joined cmdline, and that text
    cannot answer this question -- not with a wider boundary class, not with a
    different anchor. ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` separates arguments with NUL bytes, so
    ``["grep", "-rn", "vitest run"]`` and ``["grep", "-rn", "vitest", "run"]`` join
    to the SAME string: one greps for a phrase, the other is the phrase. Any
    expression over the joined form necessarily treats them alike, so the decision
    belongs where the separators still exist.

    On the argv the statement is short. A whole-suite run is the program, then its
    ``run`` subcommand, then nothing:

    * the program has to be vitest's own token, so a phrase carried INSIDE one
      argument -- a grep pattern, a filename, an echoed string -- names no program.
      The name is compared whole, after ``_basename`` drops any directory it was
      qualified with, which is every spelling the pattern can select: the pattern
      wants whitespace directly after ``vitest``, so a suffixed entry point
      (``vitest.cmd``, ``vitest.mjs``) never reaches this function at all;
    * ``run`` has to be its own final token, so a mention that trails a command
      cannot supply it;
    * nothing may follow, which is what "invoked with no file argument" means and
      is the condition the ``\\s*$`` anchor reaches for. Keeping it as "no argument
      at all" rather than "no TARGET argument" makes this decision a strict SUBSET
      of the pattern's: every argv answered True here also matches the pattern, so
      the set of processes reported can only shrink. A run carrying an option and no
      file (``vitest run --reporter=dot``) is whole-suite in fact and stays quiet,
      the same as under the pattern alone -- widening that is a change to which
      shapes the conductor stops mid-turn, which is a decision of its own and not
      this one's to make.

    Of those three, the SEPARATION is what the joined text cannot supply and what
    the pattern therefore cannot check. The trailing shape it can: ``\\s*$`` already
    implies ``run`` ends the text for every cmdline the pattern selects. Stating the
    whole shape here regardless keeps the decision readable on its own and keeps it
    correct if the pattern is ever retuned, rather than leaving it right only
    because something upstream happened to filter its input.

    What this does NOT separate: a runner name standing alone as another program's
    argument, ``echo vitest run``. Telling that from a launcher that really does run
    vitest needs a list of every launcher rather than a shape, and a list is what
    silently loses the launcher nobody added -- so the residual error stays on the
    reporting side, where a line names a pid an operator can dismiss.

    """The command that matched, reduced to names and flags that can hold no secret.

    A pid alone cannot say whether a match is a real run or a filename that reads
    like one: answering that means opening ``ps`` by hand, and by then the process
    is often gone. So the line carries the command -- but a command line is exactly
    where a credential or a presigned URL rides, which is why the rest of this
    scan derives words from the argv and never echoes it.

    Both are satisfied by printing only shapes that cannot carry a secret:

    * the leading token and any runner token, as a BASENAME drawn from a FIXED
      vocabulary -- the program's name is what identifies the command, while its
      directory is the part that leaks a checkout layout. The vocabulary is the point:
      a program-shaped word is the same text as a credential with no ``/`` and no
      ``=`` in it, so echoing whatever a shape test admitted would put a secret on the
      line, and an unrecognised program is counted instead. A versioned alias is
      RECOGNISED by a shape and PRINTED as a fixed label (``_alias_program_label``), so
      what lands on the line is still drawn from a closed set: the digits the command
      carried never appear. A token holding ``=`` is never a
      program name: it is an inline environment assignment, whose value can itself
      contain ``/``, so the ``=`` is tested BEFORE the directory is dropped --
      otherwise the tail of ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=…/abc`` arrives as ``abc``;
    * option NAMES, with the value dropped at the ``=``. LONG names come from a fixed
      vocabulary for the same reason programs do, since ``--`` and letters is as good
      a credential as it is an option. A SHORT one is exempt because it admits a
      single letter: its value is glued on with nothing to split at
      (``-kMyCustomerName``), so only a bare two-character short flag is echoed whole
      and a longer one keeps its first two characters;
    * nothing else, and no option's value -- not even the cap flag's. ``-n0`` prints as
      ``-n`` like every other flag: its digits are the field the rule judged, but a
      caller-supplied ``banned_process_res`` can point this scan at a program whose
      ``-n`` value is a numeric secret, and no shape separates a worker count from an
      account id. What the line loses is the ``-n0``-versus-``-n auto`` readout, and
      only under a custom rule -- a DEFAULT-rule line never carries a digits-valued cap
      at all, because that is exactly the run the rule declines to report.
    * Targets and bare words are counted, not shown, and the count is
      printed as ``+<n>`` so a truncated command cannot read as a complete one. An
      option's VALUE is not in that count: it is dropped at the name boundary, and a
      flag printed without a value is itself the record that one went. A retained
      token is clipped at ``_MAX_CMD_TOKEN_CHARS`` and marked ``~`` -- a backstop for a
      later vocabulary entry, since nothing printable today approaches it.

    The text comes from the same ``cmdline`` read the rule matched, so it cannot
    disagree with ``rule=`` about what was seen. Splitting on whitespace means an
    argument containing a space arrives as several tokens; that costs nothing,
    because the pieces are judged by the same shapes and an unrecognised piece is
    withheld like any other.

    *span* is where in *cmd* the thing being reported sits, and it selects the one
    command segment to reduce. A joined-line rule passes its own match span, because a
    shell string can hold several commands and only the matched one is worth printing.
    The ARGV path passes the whole of *cmd*: what it reported is a single command read
    from NUL-separated tokens, so there is no other command in there to narrow to, and
    a separator character sitting inside one of its arguments is data rather than an
    end.

#: A probe samples; it does not subscribe. So it can only ever see a session's
#: newest message, and a state that was overwritten between two samples is not
#: suppressed or deferred -- it is never observed at all. ``BLOCKED`` is exactly
#: the state that gets overwritten, because the protocol requires a blocked
#: worker to keep reporting status, so its own next message displaces the only
#: place a sampling probe looks. The debt then exists on both sides and is
#: visible to neither: the worker holds position waiting for a ruling, and the
#: conductor never learned it owes one.
#:
#: Sticky is what survives the sample. A sticky report is not cleared by a
#: heartbeat or by unprefixed text; only another real report clears it, and the
#: conductor's own act of delivering the ruling (``--mark-handled``) is what
#: quiets it.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT merged with ``TERMINAL_TAGS``: ``TERMINAL`` means close me,
#: sticky ``BLOCKED`` means a ruling is owed. Those call for opposite actions, so
#: collapsing them would trade one invisible obligation for a wrong one.
#:
#: KNOWN BOUND, stated rather than left to be discovered: stickiness reaches only
#: as far back as the parse window. A blocked worker that heartbeats long enough
#: eventually pushes its own report past ``tail_bytes`` (200 KB), and the ruling
#: debt goes invisible again -- the same loss class this fixes, deferred rather
#: than closed. Raising ``tail_bytes`` buys proportionally more time; making it
#: unconditional would mean parsing every transcript in full on every cycle.
#:
#: The durable handled set cannot close it, which is worth spelling out because it
#: looks like it should. ``proto`` there is written ONLY by ``--mark-handled``, so
#: it exists exactly when the ruling has already been delivered -- and in that
#: case the signal is correctly suppressed by digest, so reading it would change
#: nothing. In the case the bound actually bites, an UNDISPOSITIONED report ageing
#: out, there is no mark and therefore no recorded tag to read. Sourcing
#: stickiness from the state file would either be a no-op or re-fire answered
#: rulings forever, so the transcript stays the source of truth and the bound
#: stays honest.

    It counts from the START of the file, not the start of the window. A
    window-relative count saturates the moment a transcript passes ``tail_bytes``
    (200 KB by default) and then stays frozen while the session talks -- reading,
    at exactly the sizes real worker sessions reach, as the deadlock it exists to

    It counts only rows the session PRODUCED -- its own messages and its tool
    activity -- never inbound ones. A transcript holds nudges, injected recovery
    notices and user turns as well, so counting every row means the conductor's
    OWN nudge advances the index of the worker it just nudged, and a wedged
    session reads as progress precisely when the conductor pokes it. Counting
    tool rows IS deliberate: a session running tools is working even while it is

    """Is *argv* a known shell running a command string rather than the tool it names?

    The banned-operation rules are matched against the whole joined cmdline, which
    is what makes an arg-shaped rule expressible at all -- ``\\bvitest\\b\\s+run\\s*$``
    is a statement about the ARGUMENTS, and the pytest rule reads the worker count
    out of them. The cost of matching that far is that a wrapper's argument is read
    as the wrapper's own program: ``bash -c 'cd x && pytest -n 8'`` is reported as
    an unbudgeted pytest while the process that exists is a shell.

    Skipping the wrapper removes a misattribution and loses no coverage, because
    the probe scans EVERY process: a genuinely running wrapped tool has its own
    pid and is matched there on its own merits. Attributing it to the wrapper as
    well only makes the conductor stop the wrong pid.

    That "loses no coverage" argument rests on the wrapped tool still being alive
    at the next ``/proc`` walk, which is true of the two built-in rules and NOT
    guaranteed of an operator's own. The caller therefore consults this function
    only for a match on a built-in rule; a custom ``banned_process_res`` reports
    the wrapper as it did before the fix.

    Takes real ARGV, not a joined string. Once NUL separators become spaces, an
    argument containing a space is indistinguishable from two arguments, so the
    option/operand structure this function has to read cannot be recovered.

    Three spellings of the same flag all have to be recognised, and each one was
    a live misattribution before it was:

    * alone -- ``bash -c 'pytest'``
    * grouped into a cluster -- ``bash -lc``, ``bash -ic``, ``sh -euxc``; a login
      shell is the commonest spelling of all
    * behind an option that takes an OPERAND -- ``bash -o pipefail -c``, and its
      long forms ``bash --rcfile /dev/null -c`` and ``bash --init-file f -c``

    BusyBox is a multi-call binary, so the applet -- not ``busybox`` -- is the
    effective program, and it is resolved before the option scan starts. Which
    argv entry names it depends on how the applet was invoked, and only ONE of the
    two spellings puts it in argv[1]:

    * through a SYMLINK, the standard form -- ``argv[0]`` is the applet
      (``/usr/bin/wget``) while ``exe`` resolves to busybox itself
    * explicit multi-call dispatch -- ``busybox sh -c '...'`` names the applet in
      argv[1], where every other shell would put an option

    Reading argv[1] for the symlink form left ``base`` as ``busybox``, which is a
    shell, so a banned applet carrying a ``-c``-shaped flag (``wget -c URL``) was
    read as a shell holding a command string and dropped from the scan.

    * ``/proc`` hands arguments over NUL-separated, so an argument's own bytes can
      never be mistaken for syntax -- a ``|`` in a log format or a parametrized node id
      is data, and the ``-n`` behind it is still the run's own.
    * argparse resolves a repeated option LAST-wins, so ``-n 4 -n auto`` is a budgeted
      run and ``-n auto -n 4`` is not. The tokens are walked to the end and the final
      specification is the one judged; a lookahead that stops at the first number
      cannot say which came last.
    * pytest's ``--`` ends its options. Every token behind it is a file or a node id,
      so ``-n32 -- -n0`` is a 32-worker run pointed at a path called ``-n0``, and the
      walk stops there.
    * ``-o addopts=...`` / ``--override-ini addopts=...`` replace the ``addopts`` the
      run starts from, and pytest puts that value IN FRONT of the run's own arguments.
      The override's tokens are walked first, so ``-o addopts='-n 16'`` is a 16-worker
      run, and ``-o addopts='-n 16' -n auto`` is budgeted by the run's own last word.

    No ``-n`` at all is budgeted: the default ``addopts`` supply ``-n auto``, and
    reporting a bare pytest would flag every targeted single-file run a worker makes.
    An override that supplies none runs one process with xdist inactive, which is the
    same answer.

    What it must not do is read SOMEBODY ELSE's option as the runner's. ``nice -n 10
    pytest test/`` has no worker count of its own -- the ``10`` is a priority -- and
    ``xvfb-run -n`` is the same shape; both launchers this scan recognises. So the scan
    starts after the runner's own token, and when no runner token stands alone it
    declines to answer at all, which reports (fail-closed) rather than exonerates.

    It reads argv and nothing else. ``-c other.ini`` names a file whose ``addopts``
    this reader does not open, and ``--noconftest`` / ``--confcutdir`` decide which
    ``conftest.py`` loads; the checkout, not the command line, is where those are
    answered, and the probe already keys the stop on ``cwd=fleet`` for that reason.

    """Is the token at *index* the PROGRAM being run, rather than an argument to one?

    This is the whole reason these spellings are detected on the argv side. ``pytest-3``
    is a real invocation, a directory ``pytest-of-ci/pytest-3``, and a package name;
    ``py.test`` is a real invocation and a plausible filename. In each case the strings
    are identical -- so what separates them is what stands in FRONT.

    The token qualifies at ``argv[0]`` unless the kernel's own binary for this pid
    contradicts it, or when the command opens with a launcher this script recognises: a
    launcher's job is to run something else, so a runner after one is still the program
    -- but only until the launcher's own subject appears.

    An INTERPRETER is the sharp case, because it puts the program in two places and
    neither is ``argv[0]``. Python runs exactly one thing -- the module named by ``-m``,
    or the SCRIPT standing as its first non-option operand -- and every token after that
    belongs to it. So the runner qualifies at exactly one index, located by
    ``_python_execution_target`` from python's own grammar. The script spelling is
    not an edge case: a packaged ``pytest-3`` has a python shebang, so the kernel's argv
    for it is ``python3 /usr/bin/pytest-3 …`` and this is the ONLY position the ordinary
    alias run ever occupies. ``python3 worker.py pytest-3`` declines because ``worker.py``
    is the program and the alias follows it; ``python3 worker.py -m pytest-3`` declines
    for the same reason even though an ``-m`` sits right in front of the alias, because a
    script may spell its own options however it likes and python's selector came earlier;
    and ``python3 cleanup.py /var/tmp/pytest-of-ci/pytest-3`` declines with an operand
    that is a pytest temp path whose last component is alias-shaped exactly as every
    pytest temp path's is.

    A SCRIPT position carries one further requirement, and the module position is declined
    outright. An import finder resolves a NAME against ``sys.path``, whose first entry is
    the working directory, so ``-m pytest-3`` reaches a checkout-local ``pytest-3.py`` as
    readily as anything installed -- and no pytest module carries a version suffix in the
    first place, the packaged ``pytest-3`` being a console script. A script is a path, and
    a path proves only that a file of that name sits there. ``python3 tools/pytest-3`` and
    ``python3 pytest-3`` run a file a checkout holds, named from the same namespace as the
    runner and indistinguishable from it by name, so the script has to be an installed
    entry point -- see ``_is_installed_entry_point``.

    ``argv[0]`` itself is the one position with no token in front of it to read, so
    there the process's own claim is checked against the kernel's binary; see
    ``_kernel_program_confirms`` for why that link has to CONFIRM, so an unreadable
    one declines rather than reporting on the process's own word.

    Behind a TRANSPARENT launcher -- one whose job is to adjust the environment and then
    exec what follows -- only that launcher's own grammar may stand in between; see
    ``_is_launcher_own_operand``. ``timeout 900 pytest-3`` and ``nice -n 10 pytest-3``
    qualify because a number is an option's value.

    Every other launcher interposes a subject of its own and therefore never puts the
    runner in the program position, at any distance. ``npm run build pytest-3`` and
    ``coverage run worker.py pytest-3`` pass an alias to a subcommand's program, and
    ``make pytest-3.12`` names a target: a per-interpreter test matrix spelling its
    targets that way is an ordinary Makefile, each target wraps a run that caps its own
    workers, and reporting it stops a healthy worker with no automatic recovery.

    An UNRECOGNISED first token disqualifies, and that is the direction to fail in
    here. ``ls /var/tmp/pytest-of-ci/pytest-3`` and ``pip install pytest-3`` are the
    two shapes the issue measured as the cost of matching the alias in the joined line,
    and both are disqualified by their own first token rather than by a pattern that has
    to guess. The cost of declining is a missed alias run behind a launcher this file
    does not describe, which is the direction it already takes for a launcher nobody
    listed at all -- and a missed line costs a signal, where a false one costs a turn.

    Asked only of python's SCRIPT position, where the kernel's binary is the interpreter
    and no ``/proc`` fact can say what the script is. Being in a directory NAMED ``bin``
    is not evidence: any checkout can hold one, so a rule satisfied by the name reports
    ``python3 <worktree>/bin/pytest-3`` -- a file the repository happens to carry -- and
    stops a healthy worker over it.

    What installing a console script actually does is write it into the same directory as
    the interpreter it was installed for, because that is what an entry point IS: the
    script's shebang names its neighbour. So the question is whether the interpreter is
    there, and *interpreter* is the name ``argv[0]`` carries -- which for the shape this
    matters for is written by the KERNEL, not chosen by the process: running
    ``/usr/bin/pytest-3`` makes the kernel build ``argv`` from the script's shebang line.

    That asks the filesystem for ONE named file, never for a directory's contents, which
    is the same shape ``_venv_root`` already uses for ``pyvenv.cfg``. Deciding from the
    installation rather than from a list of locations is what keeps the packaged run
    reportable everywhere the interpreter really sits beside its scripts -- a system
    prefix, a virtualenv and a version-manager prefix each do, so all three answer yes
    without the rule naming any of them, and a host whose interpreter is a global shim is
    not a special case at all.

    A ``pip install --user`` is a KNOWN MISS, named here rather than claimed: it writes
    the console script into ``~/.local/bin`` and no interpreter with it, so the shebang
    names the base interpreter, this check looks for ``~/.local/bin/python3``, finds
    nothing and declines. An uncapped run spelled that way emits no line. Confirming it
    would mean reading the script's own shebang -- its CONTENTS, at a path an argument
    supplied -- which is a wider surface than the directory listing this check replaced,
    so the miss is accepted and stated instead of closed.

    Both failure directions cost a signal rather than a turn. A RELATIVE path cannot be
    resolved from here, because the probe's working directory is not the scanned
    process's, so it declines; and a name the filesystem does not confirm declines too.

    Python runs exactly one program and its grammar says which: ``python [flags]
    (-m module | -c command | - | script) [args…]``. The first of those selectors to
    appear wins, and every token after it belongs to the thing being run. So this walk
    returns a single index plus which selector produced it -- the module after ``-m``,
    or the script operand -- and a caller compares against it rather than testing tokens
    near the candidate. The kind matters because a module name is resolved by the import
    machinery while a script is a path, so only one of the two can be checked for being
    an installed entry point.

    That single-index shape is the point. Asking only whether the PREVIOUS token is
    ``-m`` accepts ``python3 worker.py -m pytest-3``, where ``worker.py`` is the program
    and ``-m pytest-3`` is a pair of arguments that script was handed -- a script may

    discards its turn, so the selector has to be python's own first one, not any ``-m``
    anywhere in the line.

    Both selector positions matter for this file. A packaged ``pytest-3`` is a python
    script with a shebang, so the kernel's argv for ``/usr/bin/pytest-3 test/x.py`` is
    ``python3 /usr/bin/pytest-3 test/x.py``: the alias stands as the SCRIPT and never
    appears at ``argv[0]``. ``python3 -m pytest-3`` names it as a MODULE. Both are the
    program; ``python3 worker.py pytest-3`` and ``python3 cleanup.py
    /var/tmp/pytest-of-ci/pytest-3`` are neither.

    A token this grammar cannot classify returns None, which declines. That keeps the
    failure in the direction this file fails in everywhere else: an unrecognised shape
    is not detected rather than reported, because a missed line costs a signal and a

    to read -- so without the kernel's answer this path would stop a healthy worker on
    the strength of a name the process picked for itself.

    The link must CONFIRM, and an unreadable one therefore declines. This is the
    opposite direction from the wrapper check one screen up, which needs positive
    evidence to EXEMPT a pid a rule already matched, so an unreadable link grants it
    nothing: here the check is what ACCUSES, and an accusation with no evidence behind
    it is exactly the shape that costs a turn. A process can make its own link
    unreadable by going non-dumpable, so treating that silence as permission to report
    would put the stop back under the process's own control.

    "Unreadable link means the pid is already sorted foreign or unknown" is NOT a

    and no readable ``cwd`` at all -- one token, a fleet-owned ``BANNED`` row, a stopped

    What declining costs is an alias-named process whose link this uid cannot read,

    worth stating because the opposite looks plausible: a shebang script's kernel binary
    is indeed the interpreter, but the kernel also puts that interpreter at ``argv[0]``
    and the runner one position later, so a shebang run is answered by the script-operand
    rule and never reaches this check. The shape that does reach it with an interpreter

    file and no second writer -- the probe stays read-only outside

    ``expected_start`` is the incarnation token captured before the per-pid reads
