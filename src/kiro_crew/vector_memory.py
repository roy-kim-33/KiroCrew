"""Vector memory — structured semantic + episodic memory with audit trail.

Storage: ~/.kiro/crew/memory.db (SQLite, WAL mode)
FAISS index: ~/.kiro/crew/memory.faiss (optional, for vector search)

Semantic: key-value store with allow-list keys, confidence gating,
conflict resolution, injection detection, and event logging.
Episodic: conversation fragments with embeddings, importance scoring,
time-decay retrieval via FAISS (falls back to FTS5 without embeddings).

:class:`VectorMemoryStore` owns the one SQLite connection and its ``_db_lock``,
the store lifecycle, the member database, record revisions, audit events and
``memory_meta``, and the write paths this module's source guards pin here:
``_write_semantic``, ``write_episodic``, ``write_lesson`` and the writer loops
that feed them. The retrieval, ranking, repair and parsing rules it delegates to
live in :mod:`kiro_crew.vector_memory_runtime`. This module re-exports their
names and is the patch surface those modules read their seams from at call time.

        :attr:`EpisodicWriteOutcome.AT_CAPACITY` is the store's own verdict at
        refusal time -- a caller must not re-derive it from a later count, which a
        concurrent cap raise or eviction can change in between.

        *facets* stamps the crew lineage's carve axes and is ignored on v1. An
        episode is the kind that most needs them: it is delivered ONLY by
        per-prompt similarity search, so the carve is the only thing that can
        bound which episodes a query is even allowed to surface.

        ``preserve_existing`` rejects similarity and capacity conflicts instead
        of tombstoning an active entry. Import paths use it to remain merge-only,
        and so does any writer that passes ``defer_embedding``: with no vector the
        similarity dedup below cannot run, and a row admitted without it must not
        evict one it was never compared against.

        ``defer_embedding`` stores the row with a NULL embedding instead of
        embedding inline, leaving it for :meth:`backfill_missing_embeddings`.
        ``embedding_resolved`` says the caller already attempted inference and
        supplied its result, including ``None``; this method then performs no
        inference of its own. Such a caller also supplies ``embedding_generation``
        from :attr:`space_generation` before inference, so a model swap in the gap
        leaves the vector NULL. Inference cost grows steeply with text length (~0.4s per 2000-char chunk
        on CPU), so a bulk writer such as the onboarding importer would hold its
        caller for minutes. The row is FTS5 keyword-searchable immediately, and
        becomes semantically searchable once the sweep fills it in. Only for
        callers that schedule that sweep — a row left NULL forever is silently
        absent from vector search. Deferral also skips the similarity dedup
        (which needs a vector), so the caller keeps its own duplicate check.

        """Write a lesson as a semantic entry with key lesson.<hash>.

        Returns which outcome occurred (see :class:`LessonWriteOutcome`) rather than a
        bare ``bool``, whose ``False`` conflated "validation refused this", "a dedup
        rule claimed it", "it is already stored exactly as submitted" and "your bare
        re-submit kept the stored clause" -- four facts a caller cannot act on without
        telling them apart. The result's TRUTH VALUE is still the old predicate (see
        :class:`LessonWriteResult`), so a caller that only needs "did this write
        something" keeps using ``if store.write_lesson(...)`` unchanged.

        Deduplicates against existing lessons:
        - Substring match: if existing contains new (or vice versa), longer wins
        - Topic overlap: if the shared significant words are >=50% of the LARGER of
          the two keyword sets, newer replaces older
        - Semantic similarity: if >85% cosine similarity, newer replaces older --
          unless a stored near-duplicate outranks this write (``user_explicit``
          over a lower-authority source, or strictly higher stored confidence),
          which reports ``deduped`` / ``semantic_similarity``.

        **A call that stores nothing deletes nothing.** Every supersede the scan
        decides on is QUEUED, and the queue drains only once ``set_semantic`` has
        committed the submission. So a ``deduped`` verdict from any branch, and a
        ``refused`` from the store's own validation, each preserve every live lesson
        row and report an empty ``superseded``. They are not byte no-ops on the
        database: a lazy embedding backfill for a row this call READ may already have
        been flushed, which changes a vector and no lesson.

        Draining after the commit puts the two outcomes in the safe order, and leaves
        one window it cannot close: a drain that stops partway -- a raised error, a
        killed process -- keeps the submission and leaves the rows it had not reached
        yet. That direction is deliberate. The residue is a duplicate, never a lost
        lesson, and the next write matching those rows retires them.

        Two of those three rules DELETE a stored lesson, and the substring rule's
        "longer wins" direction means a submitted rule can retire a stored one that
        is more general than it -- attaching a condition to a rule makes the text
        longer and the guidance NARROWER, so the row that survives can be the one
        that applies less often. That is the designed behaviour and this method
        keeps it: the
        alternative is a store that accumulates near-identical rules, which is what
        these three rules exist to prevent, and the onboarding import already shows
        the sanctioned way to opt out of it (route to ``set_semantic_if_absent``,
        which cannot replace anything -- see ``onboarding_import``).

        What it does NOT keep is the silence. Every rule that deletes records the
        rule text it removed in :attr:`LessonWriteResult.superseded`, so a caller is
        never handed a bare ``inserted`` for a call that destroyed a lesson the
        user still wanted. The result is the only place that can carry this: the
        deleted row is a tombstone, so it is gone from ``get_lessons``, from
        ``learn_list`` and from the injected lessons block by the time the caller
        looks.

        Pass ``rule_emb`` to reuse an embedding already computed by the caller
        and avoid a second blocking embed of the identical text. A caller doing
        that MUST also read :attr:`space_generation` BEFORE it embeds and pass it
        as ``rule_emb_generation``, so a model swap landing between that embed and
        this write is detected and the vector is left NULL for the backfill
        instead of being committed into the wrong space. ``rule_emb_resolved``
        additionally distinguishes an attempted embed that returned ``None`` from
        no attempt, and ``defer_backfills`` suppresses lazy legacy-row inference;
        together they let a caller keep inference outside a short publication lock.

        Runtime model-identity assertions and recognized concrete-ID model-selection
        imperatives in either persisted field are refused here, before embedding or
        deduplication. A model-version literal without either form remains durable. The
        JSONL fallback calls the same predicate, so MCP, dashboard, consolidation,
        task-runner, and direct callers share the boundary.
