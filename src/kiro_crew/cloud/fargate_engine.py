"""The Fargate launch engine, and the ownership rule its teardown turns on.

Implements the five-method :class:`~kiro_crew.cloud.launch_job.LaunchEngine`
Protocol for Fargate. The AWS-touching bodies call ``cloud/fargate/*`` to build
the ``RegisterTaskDefinition`` and ``RunTask`` request bodies and route every AWS
call through the single ``aws`` CLI chokepoint in :mod:`kiro_crew.cloud.aws`. The
two things that do NOT depend on any AWS call are here too: the ownership rule
teardown finds resources by, and the reason ``begin_signin`` has nothing to do.

**Why ownership is a module of its own rather than a line inside teardown.**
A resource is ours only if it carries the managed marker, and the marker is a
boolean that is separate from the identifier. Those are two different fields doing
two different jobs, and conflating them has a specific failure: a launch tag
written into the marker leaves a task that every convention-following consumer is
blind to, including this one. Writing the rule down as data, with the classifier
as a pure function, is what lets both halves of that property be tested -- a task
whose marker holds anything but ``"true"`` classifies as UNMARKED, and UNMARKED is
never deleted.

**Two keys, two jobs, copied from the EC2 path rather than invented.**
``ec2.py:32-33`` defines ``MANAGED_TAG_KEY = "kirocrew:managed"`` and
``INSTANCE_TAG_KEY = "kirocrew:instance"``, and every consumer treats the first as
a boolean and the second as the identifier: ``ec2.py:804`` compares
``tags.get(MANAGED_TAG_KEY) != "true"``, ``ec2.py:983`` filters
``Key=kirocrew:managed,Values=true``, and the request-tag and resource-tag
conditions in ``cloud/iam.py`` all demand ``== "true"``. So the gate is
``managed == "true"`` and the launch tag lives under its own key. Both halves of
that marker are IMPORTED here, never re-spelled: a second copy of a value whose
meaning is enforced by IAM conditions elsewhere is a copy that can drift out of
agreement with the policy that gates it.

**The launch tag's key is not spelled here either.** The module that writes the
tag onto a task owns that key, so :func:`classify_task` and
:func:`plan_teardown` read it under the imported :data:`LAUNCH_TAG_KEY`. A
private spelling here would be a second copy that nothing checks against the
writer: the moment the two disagree, every task classifies as another launch's,
teardown deletes nothing, and it reports success while the task keeps billing.
Importing the writer's own name is what makes that disagreement impossible rather
than merely unlikely, and it leaves a caller no way to hand in a wrong key.

    one, so the refusal that case exists for could not fire.

    Four cases, and the last two are the ones worth stating plainly.

    Nothing of ours is present and nothing is ambiguous: ``confirmed=True`` with
    an empty delete list. Teardown is idempotent, so a tag whose task is already
    gone is a success and not an error.

    Tasks classified :attr:`Ownership.OURS`: delete exactly those, and confirm.
    :attr:`Ownership.OTHER_LAUNCH` tasks are left alone silently -- another launch
    owns them and will tear them down itself.

    A running :attr:`Ownership.UNMARKED` task whose ``startedBy`` says this
    launcher started it: this is the ambiguous case, and it REFUSES to claim that
    task. It is not deleted, because deleting on a ``startedBy`` match alone is
    deleting by a guess when the marker that authorises deletion is absent. It is
    not ignored either, because a task this launcher plausibly started and cannot
    claim is a task that bills until a human intervenes. So the plan returns
    ``confirmed=False`` and names the ARN -- which surfaces through the existing
    caller as a warning the user can act on. A mislabelled marker produces exactly
    this shape in production, so it is the case with a test.

    A running :attr:`Ownership.MISLABELLED` task: the same refusal through a
    different door. The marker is present and the ``startedBy`` is this launcher's,
    but the launch tag -- the value that authorises this launch to claim a task --
    is absent or names another launch. Deleting on the ``startedBy`` match would
    override the one field whose job is to say whose task it is; skipping it would
    leave a task this launcher started to bill unattended. So it is refused the
    same way, and the warning says WHICH refusal fired, because the operator's
    next step differs: an unmarked task may not be theirs at all, while a
    mislabelled one is theirs and wrongly tagged.

    Both refusals apply only to a running task. ``STOPPED`` is the one ECS state
    that costs nothing, and a warning that tells the operator to stop a task that
    is already stopped is noise that trains them to ignore the real one.

    The refusal is per task, not per teardown. Authority to stop an
    :attr:`Ownership.OURS` task comes from that task's own marker and is not
    withdrawn by an unclaimable neighbour, so when both are present the plan still
    deletes ours, still returns ``confirmed=False`` because something may be left
    billing, and the warning names both halves: what is being stopped and what
    could not be claimed.

    A Fargate task is unattended by construction (RFC section 7), which is the

    watching, and a disposable task is not. So the bound cannot be "a human
    notices", and this is where the alternative is written down.

    ``ttl_seconds`` is a wall-clock cap on one task's life, enforced by stopping
    it. ``max_running`` is a cap on how many of this launcher's tasks may run at
    once in one cluster, enforced by REFUSING a launch rather than by stopping
    anything: which of several running tasks is the leak is not knowable from a
    read, and stopping one on that guess is the error the ownership rule exists
    to avoid. A refusal costs a launch; a wrong stop costs a running crew.

    There is deliberately no idle bound here. An idle-stop needs a last-activity

    carries lifecycle timestamps and no use, the only activity a task has is

    """Decide which of *crew*'s sighted tasks are over their lifetime, and which are
    inside it.

    Deliberately takes no launch tag. A TTL has to reach a task whose tag the
    caller has forgotten -- ``launch_job._new_tag`` mints a fresh random tag for
    every launch, so a sweep scoped to the tag in hand would bound the one task
    that is certainly fine and never the leftovers, which are the whole reason a
    TTL exists. So each sighting supplies its own launch tag and ownership is
    decided per task.

    Attribution is what *crew* is for, and it is the rule this sweep turns on.
    A cluster-wide read reaches every task in the cluster, and a shared account
    can hold a colleague's crew, so the sweep needs a value that says WHOSE a
    managed task is. Two candidates do not: :func:`classify_task` against a
    sighting's own tag can only answer the MARKER half, because ``launch_tag``
    equals the tag the sighting itself carries and so matches by construction;
    and :func:`_started_by_for` is a prefix plus that same tag, carrying no host
    or crew component, so a genuine task of ANY crew satisfies it. Both are kept
    -- the first keeps an unmarked task out of the stop list including the case
    where the launch tag was written into the marker itself, and the second
    refuses a task whose ``startedBy`` disagrees with its own tag -- but neither
    can attribute, and treating them as if they could is how a sweep stops a
    neighbour's running crew. :data:`CREW_TAG_KEY` is the value that attributes:
    ``runtask.run_task_request`` writes the launching crew's name onto every task
    it starts, and a crew name is stable across launches, which is exactly the
    property a TTL needs and a launch tag lacks.

    An empty *crew* is refused rather than treated as a wildcard. It is the one
    value that would match nothing and therefore appear to match everything to a
    reader, and a bound sweep that silently widened to the whole cluster is the
    failure this parameter exists to prevent.

    A ``STOPPED`` task is skipped before anything else. It costs nothing, so it
    is neither stopped again nor counted against the cap.

    A task whose age cannot be established -- no ``startedAt`` and no
    ``createdAt`` in the read -- is never stopped for age. That is the safe
    direction: stopping on an unknown age would stop a task that may have started
    a second ago. It is counted as running, so it still presses against the cap,
    and it is named in the warning so the case is auditable rather than silent.

    A managed task carrying a launch tag and this launcher's stamp but NO crew tag
    is treated the same way: never stopped, counted as running, and named. It
    cannot be attributed, so it may be a leftover of this crew from a launcher too
    old to have written the tag, or a neighbour's from the same. Counting it
    presses the cap and can refuse a launch that would otherwise have gone ahead,
    which is the direction this module already chose -- a refusal costs a launch,
    a wrong stop costs a running crew. A task whose crew tag names a DIFFERENT
    crew is skipped in silence, because on a shared cluster it is not this
    launcher's business and naming every one of them would be noise an operator
    learns to scroll past.

    here is refused inside an agent session by design -- a Fargate launch is a
    human/installer action, run from a terminal, exactly as the EC2 lane is.

    The engine is given its :class:`FargateLaunchSpec` at construction rather than
    inventing one in :meth:`provision`, because the launch job hands ``provision``
    no placement, image or secrets and there is no configuration home for them on
    this branch. Without a spec, :meth:`preflight` and :meth:`provision` refuse by
    naming the fields an operator must supply.

    The revision cache maps a spec's :func:`revision_fingerprint` to the task
    definition revision NUMBER that carries it. A cache hit is confirmed against
    the account through ``DescribeTaskDefinition`` before it is launched: a
    remembered number whose ``kirocrew:revision-key`` tag differs from the spec's
    fingerprint is a stale cache, not a launch.

        else ``("", reason, alive)``.

        The new AWS read this lane needs. ``RunTask`` answers with a task ARN and
        nothing else, so the launcher holds two of an SSM ECS target's three
        fields; the third, the container's ``runtimeId``, exists only once ECS has
        started the container, and ``DescribeTasks`` is the only place it is
        readable. This polls that read on :data:`REGISTER_TARGET_POLL_SECONDS` up
        to :data:`REGISTER_TARGET_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` of ELAPSED time -- the last
        sleep is shortened to whatever the budget has left, so the ceiling is the
        documented number and not that number plus one round trip per poll -- and
        returns on the first answer that carries one.

        Never raises, and returns a REASON rather than a bare failure, because
        every way this ends badly is a different thing for its owner to do:

        * the task has left ``RUNNING`` -- ECS's own ``stoppedReason`` is quoted,
          since that is where the cause is (an image it could not pull, a secret
          it could not read). There is no crew to add and none to tear down;
        * ECS does not list the task -- :meth:`describe_task` answers ``None``.
          This counts as gone only AFTER some read has seen the task, because
          ``RunTask`` and ``DescribeTasks`` are eventually consistent: a task
          accepted moments ago is legitimately absent from the first read, and
          treating that as gone would fail the launch of a task that is starting
          normally and going on to bill. So an absence before any sighting is
          polled like any other not-ready answer, and only a DISAPPEARANCE -- an
          absence after a sighting -- ends it;
        * the read is denied or otherwise fails -- the ``ecs:DescribeTasks``
          error, which names the caller ARN on an AccessDenied;
        * the budget ran out -- the honest answer, and the one case where simply
          looking again later works. Its wording separates a task ECS never
          listed from one that was listed and stayed pre-``RUNNING``, because
          those are different things to go and look at.

        The third element separates those: ``alive`` is False only when this read
        SAW a task that is gone or past running, and True whenever the task may
        still come up -- including when the read itself failed, so a denied
        ``DescribeTasks`` never reports a live crew as dead, and including a task
        no read has managed to see yet. :meth:`register` is what turns that into a
        fatal or non-fatal failure; the distinction is a fact about the task, so it
        is established here, where the task was read.

        A target is composed only from a task that is
        :attr:`~TaskSighting.is_serving`, and every state after ``RUNNING`` is
        refused before that point. ``runtimeId`` outlives the container that had
        it: a container that reached ``RUNNING`` and then began stopping still
        carries one through ``DEACTIVATING``, ``STOPPING`` and ``DEPROVISIONING``,
        so a check that reads the runtime id -- or that asks
        :attr:`~TaskSighting.is_running`, which answers a billing question and
        admits every state but ``STOPPED`` -- would compose a well-formed target
        for a task whose ENI is being torn down and report the launch as
        connectable. A task not serving YET is a different case and is polled, not
        refused.

        The composed target goes through :func:`split_ecs_target`, the registry's
        own reader, before being returned. A cluster or id that cannot be read
        back is refused HERE, where the reason can name the parts, rather than at

        *instance_id* is the task ARN ``provision`` returned. The registry
        addresses a Fargate crew by ECS target instead, so this resolves one from
        the other through :meth:`await_registration_target` and registers THAT as
        the record's ``ssm_target``, with ``connection_method="fargate"`` and
        ``remote_port`` the port the task definition publishes
        (:data:`~kiro_crew.cloud.fargate.FRONT_PORT`) -- not
        ``register_instance``'s default, which is the EC2 lane's remote dashboard
        port and would forward the tunnel to a port nothing in the container
        listens on.

        Idempotency is ``register_instance``'s own and is not re-implemented here:
        it matches an existing record by ``ssm_target``, so registering the same
        task twice (a retried launch job on one task) updates that record in place
        and preserves its id, allocated local port and sticky connect intent.

        The record is stamped ``provisioner_id=FARGATE_PROVISIONER_ID``, not
        ``register_instance``'s default, which is the EC2 lane's. The field is
        persisted source metadata: the engine that drives a launch is resolved from
        the launch job's own provisioner id, never from a registry record, so this
        stamp selects nothing. What reads it is the dashboard's crew list, which
        captions a row by it and chooses the lifecycle guidance and Remove warning
        it shows -- so a Fargate task left with the EC2 default is presented as an
        EC2 instance and its owner is pointed at the wrong console.

        Which failure is fatal follows the task, not the lane.
        :class:`~kiro_crew.cloud.launch_job.RegistrationUnavailable` says the
        launch stands and only the registry row is missing, so it is raised while
        the task may still be running: there is a billing task, and the remedy --
        add it under Remote crew, or tear it down -- needs the launch reported as
        launched rather than under a red card. A task that has been SEEN and is
        now gone or terminal has neither, so that case raises ``RuntimeError`` and
        fails the launch, which is what ``RegistrationUnavailable`` documents as
        the meaning of raising anything else. A task no read has seen yet is not
        that case: ECS is eventually consistent, so it is polled. Reporting a dead
        task as launched would leave the job DONE for a crew nothing can reach,
        and failing the launch of a task that is merely slow to appear would
        report a billing crew as absent.

        One reader for both consumers. ``teardown`` asks about one launch and

        passes nothing, because a lifetime has to reach a task whose tag nobody
        remembers. A second reader would be two places deciding which fields
        ownership is judged from, and the moment they disagreed one consumer
        would classify every task as another launch's.

        ``startedBy`` must be the ONLY ``ListTasks`` filter -- the API rejects it
        combined with any other -- so there is no ``--desired-status`` here.
        ``RUNNING`` is the API default and ownership is decided from each task's
        ``lastStatus``, not from this filter.

        Paginated, which the single-launch read did not need and the cluster-wide
        one does: ``ListTasks`` answers at most a page at a time, so stopping at
        the first page would leave every task past it unbounded -- and unbounded
        is the state this sweep exists to end. The token loop is kept even though
        the CLI normally makes it unnecessary, because a profile configured not to
        auto-paginate would otherwise read one page and silently under-sweep, and
        a silent under-sweep is worse than a loop that iterates once.

        The ``DescribeTasks`` batch is capped HERE, at
        :data:`DESCRIBE_TASKS_MAX`, and not by a page boundary. The CLI
        auto-paginates ``ListTasks`` and merges every page into one response
        carrying no ``nextToken``, so ``arns`` normally holds the WHOLE cluster in
        a single iteration -- which means a batch sized by "one page" is sized by
        nothing at all. Above the API's ceiling ``DescribeTasks`` refuses, and
        because that refusal propagates out through ``reap`` to ``provision``, the
        result would be that every launch fails on a cluster holding more than
        that many tasks. That is the cluster this sweep is for, so the cap is the
        difference between a bound that works where it matters and one that only
        works on a quiet account.
