    row whatsoever, and a KAS block asserting in prose whose token it used. Each
    was a separate edit, so a harness that became selectable without one was
    simply silent here -- which is how a signed-out harness could read as ready.
    Now the row comes from ``agent_sdk.host_auth``, the same declaration the
    credential floor and ``GET /api/acp-backends`` read, so doctor cannot say
    something the panel contradicts.

    Iterates ``acp_backends.selectable_backend_values()`` -- the sorted form of
    ``selectable_backends()``, which is already this module's neighbourhood via
    ``_doctor_claude_backend``'s local ``acp_backends`` import. Chosen over
    ``agent_sdk.probe_backends()`` for two reasons: it is the set the operator can
    actually select (a policy-denied harness needs no sign-in advice), and it
    answers without spawning the install probes' subprocesses, which this row does
    not need.

    **This checks only credentials that are the host's own, and deliberately.**
    Two stores qualify: the HOST identity store, probed through ``kiro-cli
    whoami`` (kiro-cli signs in to it, so its state is the host's own and
    readable here), and Crew's own sign-in vault, which a harness in
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_HOST_AUTH_CALLBACK`` draws on whenever the vault holds a
    usable identity -- the same runtime decision the KAS relay makes at spawn,
    so the row reports the store the next spawn will actually use. Every other
    harness keeps its entitlement in a file it owns, and reading that file is
    exactly what the credential floor exists to forbid -- a probe here would be
    the one reader the floor cannot fence. So those rows name the store and
    print the declared remedy unprobed: advice that is always correct beats a
    verdict obtained by breaking the floor.

    Advisory only, which is why it takes no ``issues`` list: a harness the operator
    has not signed into is not a broken installation, and failing doctor's exit code
