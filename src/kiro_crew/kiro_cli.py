#: absent from the session while ``--agent kirocrew`` resolves to the default

#: The floor is the release actually PROBED, for the same reason

#: lowering it once an older release is verified is a one-line change, while
#: granting it to a release that refuses the field costs the user every tool with
#: nothing red to say why.
#:
#: What authorizes lowering it: install the candidate release (a 2.x between
#: 2.10.0 and 2.23.0), put a spec carrying ``"permissions": {"rules": []}`` in
#: its agents directory, start a session with ``--agent`` naming that spec, and

    Sync and unbounded: it stats directories under the home directory. The
