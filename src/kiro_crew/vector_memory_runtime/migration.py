"""Legacy and derived memory sources, read into what the store's writers accept.

``VectorMemoryStore.migrate_from_markdown`` imports Global V1's ``lessons.jsonl``
and ``workspace/memory`` Markdown, and ``promote_episodic_patterns`` turns a
cluster of repeated episodes into one semantic fact. Both keep their writes on the
store; this module only reads the sources: it parses legacy files in the order
the migration writes them (the Markdown through the ``MemoryFiles`` the store
resolves and passes in), clusters episode vectors, and infers a fact's key and
value from episode text. Nothing here opens the database.
