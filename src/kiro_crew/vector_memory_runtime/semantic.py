    ``False`` when it is not. The comparison rides in the UPDATE rather than a
    read before it, so no writer can land between the two -- ``_db_lock`` orders
    this process alone, and a second process on the same database file is exactly
    the writer a caller passing this argument is protecting. Same contract the
    lazy embedding backfill applies to its own UPDATE, for the same reason.

    A caller that omits it deletes whatever is stored under *key*, which is what
    an explicit forget wants.

    Pass *superseded_by* (the winning row's key) and optionally
    *supersede_reason* (why it won, e.g. ``"62% keyword overlap"``) when this
    deletion is a dedup SUPERSEDE rather than an explicit forget. Two audit
    surfaces then carry the attribution durably, so a supersession can be told
    apart from a forget and traced to its winner AFTER the fact -- even when the
    ``learn_add`` reply that named it was lost to a timed-out write:

    * the record's status is stamped ``superseded`` in ``memory_record_meta``
      (not the default ``"forgotten"`` a plain forget records), and that value is
      preserved in each revision snapshot -- so the tombstone reads apart from a
      forget both in current state and in history. (The ``memory_revisions.status``
      COLUMN is the revision's own workflow state, always ``"accepted"`` here; the
      ``superseded`` record status lives in ``memory_record_meta`` and in the
      revision's ``after`` snapshot, which is what ``get_record_metadata`` reads.)
    * the audit event records ``superseded_by`` / ``supersede_reason`` as its
      ``new_value`` instead of a bare ``None``.

    IDENTITIES only -- ``superseded_by`` is the winner's ``lesson.<digest>`` row
    id, never its text. A lesson can hold whatever the user tells the agent, and
    both sinks persist to disk; the row TEXT belongs in the redacted result
    ``superseded`` field, not here.

    Complete preferences are protected context, not recency-ranked activity,

    decides which rows are deferred to ``memory_recall`` when the store has
    outgrown the first turn, and the block then says so. Existing eligibility
    checks still decide whether a record may be used.

    Why a cap at all: ``pref.*`` is written by the consolidator, not only by
    the user, and on a long-lived store it fills with paragraph-sized rulings
    keyed as preferences (measured on one real store: 101 rows, 47,741 chars,
    median 447 chars, 22 rows over 600). Every other startup block is bounded
    (rules at 37,000, findings, skills, the discovery entry); this was the one
    that was not, and it alone had grown past the rule budget.

    When *cap* is exceeded the rows are ordered by lexical overlap with
    *query_text* — the same ranking the lesson tiers use, so a preference that
    speaks to this request survives ahead of one that does not — and kept
    whole until the next one would cross the cap. The omission notice is never
    dropped: a block that silently lost rows would read as "this user has
    fewer preferences", which is the failure the cap introduces and must
