"""The lesson read model: stored-value codec, ranking, rendering and scope.

A lesson is a ``lesson.*`` semantic row whose value is either the mapping
``{"rule", "category", "negative", ...}`` or a legacy in-band string; the codec
below reads both without guessing. The readers here decide which rows count as
lesson population, which reach a prompt and in which tier and order, which rows
a contradiction sweep or a delete may address, and they fetch through the
store's locked helpers. The write path, ``VectorMemoryStore.write_lesson``, stays
on the store and uses the same codec.
