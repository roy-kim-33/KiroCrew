"""Confined, serialized JSONL append for the decision log.

The configured home is the trusted anchor (resolved once). Its log directory
and file must not be links. POSIX uses pinned directory-relative opens. Windows
holds the anchor and the log directory open with list access and read-only
sharing until the write ends, so a data-write or delete open of either (the
handle a junction swap needs) is a sharing violation while we hold them, and then
checks the leaf handle's final path against the pinned directory, so a swap that
raced the pins is refused rather than written through.
Creating the log directory and opening the file inside it cannot be one syscall,
so that pair is re-attempted when the directory is removed between them, and an
exhausted retry reports the whole path rather than the bare ``openat`` leaf.
No worker is spawned here: lock contention and write retries share a deadline.
