## Vision — image models, natively

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/vision-tool.png" alt="Vision — Vision image input group in the picker + Settings → Chat → Vision controls" width="900">
</p>

Every model reports whether it takes images natively. The **model picker** groups **Vision — image input** (muted **Image** pill) above **Text**, so a vision model feels native, not bolted on. The new **Settings → Chat → Vision** card governs what happens on text-only models:

- **Image input mode** — `Auto` (vision-aware) / `Native` (always pixels) / `Text` (always describe via a vision subagent)
- **On text-only models** — `Describe via vision subagent` / `Switch session to vision model` / `Off`
- **Vision fallback model** — any `cmc/`/`oc/`/`ol`/`ag`/`cx` picker id, default `cmc/mimo-v2.5`

Attach any image via the composer's `+` / drag-drop (the native `FilePreviewStrip` with numbered thumbs) — it rides as real pixels on vision models (`prompt_blocks` downscales to model limits) or as a one-shot `vision_subagent_describe` on text-only ones. The **main agent** can also call **`vision_analyze({ path|url })`** directly to describe any screenshot it just captured — the image never hits the text-only upstream.

<div align="center">

<<<<<<< HEAD
| | |
=======
Every architecture below is a first-class lane: each gets its own build, its own
auto-update feed, and its own SLSA provenance attestation.

| Install path | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) |
|---|---|---|
| **CLI one-liner / wheel** | yes | yes (the wheel is `py3-none-any`; native libraries are vendored per architecture) |
| **Desktop `.deb` / `.rpm` / AppImage** | yes | yes |
| **Docker image** | yes | yes (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` under every tag, so `docker pull` picks yours) |

Take Stable unless you have a reason not to — the table below says who each
channel is for.

### Release channels

Every install path — desktop app, CLI, Docker image — offers the same three
channels. Pick by how much churn you can absorb, not by version number:

| Channel | Who it's for | Built from | Cadence |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Stable** | Everyone. The default on every install path. | The Insider build that baked long enough to be promoted | On promotion, no calendar commitment |
| **Insider** | Power users who want features days to weeks early and accept the new bugs that come with them | Release-branch release-candidate tags | Every RC |
| **Nightly** | Us and contributors. Untested `main` HEAD — expect breakage. | `main`, 06:00 UTC daily | Daily |

Stable and Insider are two update lanes of the **same** app. The desktop app
switches between them in Settings → About, a CLI install switches by re-running
the installer with `--channel`, and a container switches by pulling a different
tag. Either way, the other lane's current version then arrives as an ordinary
update.

Because they are one app, keeping a Stable *and* an Insider copy side by side
does not give you two independent installs. Both read the same desktop settings
store, so the channel is a single value and whichever copy wrote it last wins —
switch to Insider in one and the other follows. They share one update download
cache as well. `KIROCREW_HOME` does not separate them either: it moves the data
home, not the desktop settings.

Nightly is a separate app with its own name and icon, so it installs *alongside*
a Stable or Insider one rather than replacing it. That also makes it the one copy
that keeps its own channel and its own settings store. It is not a sandbox,
though: it reads the same `~/.kiro/crew` data home unless you point it elsewhere
with `KIROCREW_HOME`.

Running Insider or Nightly is a real contribution. When something looks wrong,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues) so it gets
fixed before it reaches Stable.

### One-line install

Install the prebuilt, SHA-256-verified wheel from the release CDN without
cloning the repository or running `npm` and a local build.

Stable, the default:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.crew.kiro.dev/cli.sh | sh
```

Track a faster channel, `insider` or `nightly` (see
[Release channels](#release-channels) for who each one is for):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.crew.kiro.dev/cli.sh | sh -s -- --channel insider
```

Pin an exact version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.crew.kiro.dev/cli.sh | sh -s -- --version 0.1.0
```

**Managed Python by default.** The installer runs Kiro Crew on a fully managed
Python instead of the system one: it fetches a SHA-256-pinned
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and provisions a self-contained CPython 3.12
into `~/.kiro/crew-python`, so the install never depends on (or breaks with)
the system interpreter. Existing installs migrate the next time this installer
itself runs — a staged update applied from the dashboard or the CLI's update
command keeps its current interpreter. To run
on the system interpreter instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.crew.kiro.dev/cli.sh | sh -s -- --system-python
```

The choice is sticky: it is recorded next to the channel, so later re-runs of
the installer keep it without
the flag. Opt back in with `--managed-python`. If the managed interpreter
cannot be downloaded (no network path to the mirror), the installer falls back
to a usable system Python 3.12+ for that run; point air-gapped hosts at a
mirror with `KIROCREW_UV_URL` (the uv tarball) and `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`
(the interpreter archive).

Open `http://localhost:5476` and start a conversation. The web dashboard works
without messaging credentials. Add a messaging channel —
[Slack](docs/guides/slack-setup.md),
[Discord](src/kiro_crew/docs/discord-integration.md),
[Telegram](src/kiro_crew/docs/telegram-integration.md),
[Teams](src/kiro_crew/docs/teams-integration.md),
[Webex](src/kiro_crew/docs/webex-integration.md),
[WeCom](src/kiro_crew/docs/wecom-integration.md),
[WeChat](src/kiro_crew/docs/weixin-integration.md),
[WhatsApp](src/kiro_crew/docs/whatsapp-integration.md),
[Feishu](src/kiro_crew/docs/feishu-integration.md), or
[iMessage](src/kiro_crew/docs/imessage-integration.md) — when you want to continue
working with the same agent away from the dashboard. Apart from Teams (which
needs a public HTTPS webhook — see its guide) and iMessage (which talks to
Messages.app on the same Mac), these channels connect
outbound, so you do not need to expose the dashboard port publicly.

### Docker

For always-on servers, the Gateway ships as a public multi-arch image on GHCR:

```bash
docker run -d --name kirocrew \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5476:5476 \
  -v kirocrew-home:/home/kirocrew \
  ghcr.io/kirodotdev/kirocrew:stable
```

See the [Docker guide](docs/guides/docker.md) for first-run login, channel tags, and
the container security model.

### Build from source

macOS and Linux require Python 3.12+, Node.js 22+ (24 LTS recommended), npm, and
[`kiro-cli`](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/). The first desktop or dashboard launch
can install Kiro CLI on the Gateway host and guide device-code sign-in before
chat opens. Windows is supported through a native source install; follow the
[Windows guide](docs/guides/windows-install.md) instead of the shell steps below.

```bash
# 1. Clone and build Kiro Crew
git clone https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew.git
cd KiroCrew
make build
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Configure, verify, and start
kirocrew setup
kirocrew doctor
kirocrew gateway
```

## Why Kiro Crew

Most agent sessions end when the chat closes. Kiro Crew runs continuously on
hardware you control and keeps working between conversations.

**Persistent.** Sessions, memory, schedules, and task checkpoints survive
Gateway restarts, and scheduled or reactive work continues without someone at
the terminal.

**Self-learning.** Corrections and task failures become durable lessons.
Preferences and project context carry into new sessions.

**Self-evolving.** Repeated patterns become reusable skills. Memory, lessons,
and skills stay visible and editable, so each Kiro Crew grows more tailored to
the person and work around it.

**Runs where you choose.** Your Mac, a local container, or a remote machine
you control.

**One Gateway, many surfaces.** Work directly in the desktop app or web dashboard,
or continue the same work from the CLI and messaging surfaces like Slack and
Discord.

## What Kiro Crew does

| Capability | What it gives you |
>>>>>>> upstream/main
|---|---|
| **Works** | Vision picker grouping · Settings → Vision card · `vision_analyze` MCP tool · `agent.image_input_mode` / `image_redirect` / `vision_fallback_model` in `config.json` |
| **Bundled** | Fresh AppImage `0.2.0-customapi.5` (vite + PBS 397M) — no dev fallback, `supports_vision` on every `GET /api/models` row |

</div>

---

## Why

RoyCrew re-enables the dormant `claude_code` provider (the
`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE` seam) and adds an `opencode` backend, so you can drive
Kiro Crew through **your own model router** — Anthropic-compatible or
OpenAI-compatible — instead of Kiro's built-in AWS Bedrock catalog and account.

This fork adds:

- `agent.provider` accepts **`claude_code`** and **`opencode`** in addition to the default `acp` (kiro-cli)
- new config fields **`agent.provider_base_url`** and **`agent.provider_api_key`** (+ `provider_api_format` for OpenAI-compatible wire)
- the provider factory spawns **claude-agent-acp** (Claude Code) or **opencode acp**, pointed at your base URL, with the model id passed through unchanged (router namespaces are not registry-translated)
- **Settings → Chat provider picker** — pick a backend, then a preset (Claude Code native, Ollama Cloud, OpenCode Zen/Go, commandcode.ai, 9router, CLIProxyAPI, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Together, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic), test the connection, and allowlist models
- the GUI model picker shows **prefixed model ids** (`cmc/`, `oc/`, `ol/`, `cx/`, `ag/`); the prefix is stripped before the request leaves
- `CLIPROXY_API_KEY` env var feeds the local proxy when `provider_api_key` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are unset
- **image redirect** — when a text-only model (e.g. deepseek-flash) gets an image prompt, it's routed to a vision-capable fallback model (default `cmc/mimo-v2.5`) via `agent.image_redirect` / `agent.vision_fallback_model` / `agent.text_only_models`

Everything else — desktop app, dashboard, cron, memory, skills, subagents, apps — is upstream
kirodotdev/KiroCrew.

- **RoyCrew** (this fork) acts as the harness: sessions, tool permissions, memory, cron, dashboard.
- **claude-agent-acp** is the ACP adapter (`@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` on npm) that exposes the
  Claude Code CLI as an ACP backend.
- **Claude Code** is the agent engine. It talks to your router via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` /
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (the fork maps `CLIPROXY_API_KEY` into `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  when no other key is set).
- **CLIProxyAPI** (or any Anthropic-compatible endpoint) serves the actual models — commandcode,
  ollama-cloud, opencode-go, codex, and antigravity behind one local proxy at `http://localhost:8317`.
  No Kiro account, no AWS Bedrock, no cloud — your traffic stays on your hardware.

## Installation

### 1. Install RoyCrew from this fork

<<<<<<< HEAD
The quickest path is a source install into a virtualenv (Python 3.11+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roy-kim-33/KiroCrew.git
cd KiroCrew
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/kirocrew --version
```
=======
**Gateway.** The Gateway is the long-running Kiro Crew process. It routes
messages from the desktop app, web, CLI, and the messaging surfaces listed below. It persists
session state, injects memory and skills, starts scheduled work, coordinates
subagents, brokers approvals, enforces runtime policy, and exposes activity in
the dashboard.

**Agent sessions.** A dashboard conversation, Slack thread, or Discord DM maps to
an isolated agent session. Scheduled jobs, task runs, other messaging-channel
conversations, and subagents also use managed sessions. These sessions preserve
conversation context and can run concurrently before returning results to a
parent session or configured surface.

**ACP runtime and turns.** Kiro Crew supports both a dedicated `kiro-cli` ACP
process for a session and a shared ACP runtime that multiplexes multiple session
handles. During each turn, the session sends a prompt, streams model and tool
events, resolves approvals, and returns the final result. An agent session is a
logical isolation boundary, not necessarily one OS process.

**Use the surface that fits the moment.**

| Surface | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Desktop app** | The simplest local experience, with a bundled Gateway plus multi-tab connections to local or remote Gateways. |
| **Web dashboard** | Parallel conversations, files, approvals, activity, memory, schedules, apps, settings, and system status at `localhost:5476`. |
| **Slack** | Work from DMs and threads with streaming replies, approvals, notifications, and session links back to the dashboard. |
| **Telegram** | Reach your agent from private DMs on your phone or laptop, with streaming replies, inline approvals, and commands. |
| **Discord** | Work from DMs with streaming replies and approvals delivered as message buttons. |
| **Teams** | Reach your agent from Microsoft Teams chats — replies arrive as complete messages, and approvals are answered by typing. |
| **Webex** | Work from Webex direct messages with inline approvals; progress shows as edits to one message, which the finished answer replaces. |
| **WeCom** | Chat through an outbound-connected WeCom AI bot with configured user access and streaming replies. |
| **WeChat (Weixin)** | Reach your agent from WeChat with configured user access; a typing indicator runs while the turn works and the reply arrives as complete messages. |
| **WhatsApp** | Reach your agent from WhatsApp with streaming replies, file exchange, and reactions. |
| **Feishu (Lark)** | Chat from Feishu DMs and allow-listed group chats through a custom app bot on an outbound long connection — replies arrive as complete messages. |
| **iMessage** | Chat from the Messages app on your own Mac and Apple devices, with no bot to register and no token to paste — replies arrive as complete messages. |
| **CLI** | Fast interactive chat and direct automation with `kirocrew chat`, `run`, `cron`, `spawn`, and `security`. |

**Choose how work starts.**

| Mode | Use it for | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| **Scheduled** | Briefings, audits, backups, and recurring maintenance | `kirocrew cron` or a natural-language request |
| **Proactive** | Goals that need another pass without waiting for a new user message | AutoNudge and goal-loop skills |
| **Reactive** | CI alerts, external automation, messaging-channel activity, and other events | Authenticated agent webhooks and messaging events |
| **Task runner** | Bounded projects with explicit steps, tests, review, and checkpoint resume | `kirocrew run TASK.md` |
| **Subagents** | Independent workstreams that can run concurrently | `kirocrew spawn run "task"` |

**Memory, learning, and evolution.** Kiro Crew maintains preferences, active
project context, decaying history summaries, and durable lessons. Corrections
and task failures can change later behavior, while repeated patterns can become
reusable skills. In-process embeddings add semantic retrieval for memory and
the knowledge library. The stored state remains inspectable and editable
from the dashboard. Incognito and temporary session modes let you opt out when
a conversation should not persist.

**Skills, MCP, and apps.** Markdown skills supply reusable workflows and can be
loaded only when relevant. The built-in `kirocrew-core`, `kirocrew-cron` and
`kirocrew-computer` MCP servers expose task, subagent, learning, messaging,
scheduling, and desktop-automation tools. You
can discover additional MCP servers from Kiro or Kiro Crew configuration. The
App Kit adds installable interfaces and domain workflows. Apps can add dashboard
pages, use scoped Gateway APIs, subscribe to events, and register lifecycle
hooks.

## Security and control

Kiro Crew gives an AI agent real tool access, so the controls are enforced at
the runtime boundary instead of relying only on prompt instructions.

- **Local by default.** The dashboard binds to loopback unless you explicitly
  configure a network URL. Remote dashboards require token authentication.
- **Interactive approvals.** Review tool requests in the dashboard or a
  connected messaging channel like Slack, Discord, or Telegram.
  Session-scoped trust can reduce repeated prompts without changing
  the underlying deny and sensitive-path controls.
- **OS sandbox.** On Linux and macOS, `kiro-cli` can run inside namespace or
  Seatbelt isolation. Standard, strict, and off modes make the tradeoff
  explicit. Windows offers no equivalent OS-level layer, so Kiro Crew fails
  closed there: agent subprocesses are refused rather than run unconfined, until
  you declare the
  [`sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` opt-in](docs/guides/windows-install.md#the-unsandboxed-exec-opt-in).
- **Sensitive data guards.** Kiro Crew blocks direct access to protected paths,
  strips sensitive environment variables, and redacts credential patterns from
  output before it reaches a chat surface.
- **Denied operations.** A bundled catalog of deny rules blocks destructive commands and
  common exfiltration paths even when a session has broad approval.
- **Auditability.** Security events and tool activity are recorded for review.
  Use `kirocrew security events`, `audit`, and `verify` to inspect them.
- **Governance ceiling.** Optional policy and profile files compose with a
  tightest-wins model. A running app or agent can narrow the allowed scope but
  cannot loosen the enterprise ceiling. Inspect it with `kirocrew policy show`,
  `validate`, and `explain`.

No agent security layer removes the need to protect credentials and review
high-impact actions. Avoid pasting secrets or sensitive personal data into a
chat. Read the [security architecture](docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md) and use
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting.

## Install, configure, and operate

**Installer details.** The installer verifies the wheel's SHA-256, installs through `pipx` or a
managed virtual environment, and records the channel — `stable`, `insider`, or
`nightly` — in `~/.kiro/crew/channel`. On Linux and macOS it provisions its own
CPython 3.12 by default from a SHA-256-pinned `uv`; `--system-python` opts out
and the choice is sticky across updates. The mechanics, the env vars that
override each path, and the two `pip` forms for a published wheel (channel
index, or one wheel pinned by hash) are in
[Installing and Building](docs/guides/install.md#c-self-contained-pip-wheel).
>>>>>>> upstream/main

**Prefer the desktop app?** Grab the build for your OS with the buttons at the top of this README
(AppImage for Linux, DMG for macOS Apple Silicon, Setup.exe for Windows), or browse everything under
[the latest release](https://github.com/roy-kim-33/KiroCrew/releases/latest). Use the fork's build,
not upstream's: upstream's desktop shell is provider-agnostic, but only this fork's release is verified
against the `claude_code` router backend.

### 2. Install the Claude Code backend

```bash
# Claude Code CLI (native binary)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# ACP adapter
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp

# Make sure both are on PATH
claude --version          # e.g. 2.1.222
claude-agent-acp --help   # prints the adapter banner
```

> **Note:** some npm setups require `--allow-scripts` for the postinstall that fetches the native Claude
> binary: `npm install -g --allow-scripts=@anthropic-ai/claude-code @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### 3. Run the doctor

```bash
.venv/bin/kirocrew doctor
```

You should see `claude-acp: ✅ ... (active backend)` once `agent.provider` is set to `claude_code`.

## Configuration

```bash
# Switch the backend from kiro-cli to Claude Code
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.provider claude_code

# Point it at your router (Anthropic-compatible endpoint) — e.g. CLIProxyAPI
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.provider_base_url "http://127.0.0.1:8317"

# Optional: API key for the router. If unset, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or the
# fork-specific CLIPROXY_API_KEY from the environment is used instead.
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.provider_api_key "your-key"

# Pick a model — use the PREFIXED id from the Model prefixes table
# (e.g. cmc/deepseek-v4-pro)
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.model "cmc/deepseek-v4-pro"
```

Equivalent environment variables (used when the config fields are empty):

| Config field            | Environment variable    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| `agent.provider_base_url` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`  |
| `agent.provider_api_key`  | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   |
| `agent.model`             | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`     |
| *(local proxy key)*       | `CLIPROXY_API_KEY` — fallback when `provider_api_key` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are unset |

The `provider_api_key` config field is stored in plaintext in `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` — prefer an
environment variable (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLIPROXY_API_KEY`) if your router requires a key.

## Model prefixes

CLIProxyAPI's five providers share model names — `deepseek-v4-flash` exists on both commandcode and
opencode-go, `gpt-5.6-luna` on both commandcode and codex. The router picker therefore shows
**prefixed ids** so you can tell them apart. Before the request reaches the proxy, RoyCrew strips the
known prefix and sends the **raw id** — CLIProxyAPI rejects prefixed spellings (`unknown provider`).

Provider base URLs and notes:

- `cmc/` → commandcode — `https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1`
- `oc/` → opencode-go — `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`.
  provider (kept so existing configs keep working).
- `ol/` → ollama-cloud — `https://ollama.com/v1`. Only `deepseek-v4-flash:0731` is exposed — the other
  ollama-cloud models are deliberately not in the picker.
- `cx/` → codex — models owned by OpenAI via Codex OAuth. `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` is **not** included
  (verified to 400 upstream).
- `ag/` → antigravity — three OAuth accounts, round-robin.

Rules: a known prefix is stripped and the raw id is sent upstream; an unknown or absent prefix passes
through **unchanged**; an empty alias value means "default" — no special alias is applied.

| Prefix | Provider | Picker id | Raw id sent upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/deepseek-v4-pro` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/deepseek-v4-flash` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/Kimi-K3` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K3` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/Kimi-K2.7-Code` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/Kimi-K2.7-Code-Highspeed` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code-Highspeed` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/Kimi-K2.6` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/Kimi-K2.5` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` |
| `cmc/` | commandcode | `cmc/GLM-5.2` | `zai-org/GLM-5.2` |

## Tutorial: plug in your own models

This is the whole point of the fork. Any router or gateway that speaks the **Anthropic Messages API**
(`POST /v1/messages`) works — [9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) included — with
**CLIProxyAPI** as the reference setup covered below.

### Step 1 — Run a CLIProxyAPI instance

<<<<<<< HEAD
CLIProxyAPI is a local Anthropic-compatible proxy that fronts five providers — commandcode,
ollama-cloud, opencode-go, codex (Codex OAuth), and antigravity — behind one endpoint. Run it anywhere
on your network so it listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8317`:
=======
This is separate from `telemetry.enabled`, which controls **local-only**
performance metrics that never leave your machine. See
[docs/system-specs/modules/metrics.md](docs/system-specs/modules/metrics.md).

Contributions are welcome. Create a branch from `main`, keep changes focused,
and run the relevant checks before opening a pull request:
>>>>>>> upstream/main

```bash
# see the CLIProxyAPI docs for the current install method
# (self-hosted, keeps all model traffic on your hardware)
```

After startup, verify the Anthropic endpoint answers. The proxy expects **raw** model ids here —
prefixed spellings are rejected:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLIPROXY_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash:0731","max_tokens":10,
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```

> Any other Anthropic-compatible router works too — [9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router)
> being the classic reference setup. Only the prefixed-id catalog is CLIProxyAPI-specific.

### Step 2 — Point RoyCrew at it

```bash
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.provider claude_code
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.provider_base_url "http://127.0.0.1:8317"
export CLIPROXY_API_KEY="your-key"   # or provider_api_key
.venv/bin/kirocrew config set agent.model "cmc/deepseek-v4-pro"

### Step 3 — Chat / run tasks

```bash
# interactive chat via the CLI
.venv/bin/kirocrew chat

# run a spec file end-to-end (decompose -> execute -> review)
.venv/bin/kirocrew run TASK.md --no-test --fresh

# or use the desktop app / dashboard as usual
```

To let `kirocrew run` execute tools without an interactive approval handler, add an auto-approve pattern:

```bash
# in ~/.kiro/crew/config.json:
# "hooks": { "auto_approve_tools": ["*"] }
```

### Step 4 — Verify it really uses your router

```bash
.venv/bin/kirocrew doctor            # claude-acp: ✅ (active backend)
# or watch the gateway log while chatting:
tail -f ~/.kiro/crew/logs/*.log      # "ACP model: <your router model id>"
```

If you see `claude-opus-5[1m]` in an error message, the model id did not reach Claude Code — see
Troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

### "There's an issue with the selected model (claude-opus-5[1m])"

Claude Code fell back to its built-in default model. Causes and fixes, in order:

1. **Stale `settings.local.json`** — the seed file in the workspace's `.claude/` directory is
   authoritative over env vars. Delete it (or the whole `.claude/` dir) and restart:
   ```bash
   rm -rf <workdir>/.claude
   ```
2. **`availableModels` allowlist present** — a settings file containing
   `"availableModels": ["*"]` makes Claude Code treat your router model id as "restricted by your
   organization's settings" and silently falls back to the Bedrock default. The fork only writes the
   allowlist on the Bedrock path; if you see it in a settings file, remove that key.
3. **Model id not pinned** — with a custom base URL the fork pins `"model": "<router-id>"` in
   `settings.local.json` at session spawn. If that file is missing, re-run the session.

### "Invalid value for config option model: <id>"

An old `session/set_config_option("model")` path tried to push a router id through the adapter's model
validation. The fork skips that call when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set (the model rides via
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env + `settings.local.json` instead). If you still see it, your install is not the
fork — check `git log` contains the `feat: re-enable claude_code provider` commit.

### CLIProxyAPI says "unknown provider"

The proxy only accepts raw model ids; a prefixed spelling (e.g. `cmc/deepseek-v4-pro`) is rejected. Kiro
Crew strips known prefixes automatically, so this shows up only when another client sends a prefixed id
straight at the proxy. In `curl` or other tools, use the raw id from the [Model prefixes](#model-prefixes)
table.

### Router returns 429 / quota errors

That's your router's rate limit — pick a different model id or wait. The fork does not touch retry
behavior.

## Upstream

This repository is a fork of [kirodotdev/KiroCrew](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew) (Apache 2.0).
Fork changes live on `main` (with `testing` for pre-release work), rebased onto
upstream `kirodotdev/KiroCrew` `main`. Rebase conflicts stay small as long as
the dormant seam (comments referencing `ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`) is preserved.

## Provider settings

Point the app at your own router — Claude Code (Anthropic endpoint) or
OpenCode (OpenAI-compatible endpoint), with presets for the popular gateways
(Claude Code native, Ollama Cloud, OpenCode Zen/Go, commandcode.ai, 9router,
CLIProxyAPI, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Together, Groq, OpenAI …), a
connection test, and a model allowlist so the picker only shows the models you
actually use. Choosing the **Claude Code (native)** preset leaves the base URL
empty, so Claude Code uses its own Anthropic credentials and no router sits in
the path.

## Updating from the fork

This fork updates from **its own repo** (`roy-kim-33/KiroCrew`), never
from upstream `kirodotdev/KiroCrew`.

- **Desktop app:** updates come from this repo's GitHub Releases (single
  `stable` lane). The release workflow attaches `latest-mac.yml` /
  `latest-linux.yml` automatically.
- **Gateway (git install):** the update check, the dashboard Update button,
  and the boot auto-update all follow whatever remote the current branch
  tracks. In this repo `origin` is the fork itself, so `main` tracks
  `origin/main` by default — verify once:

  ```bash
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
  ```

  Boot auto-update runs **only on branch `main`** (`git reset --hard
  <remote>/main`), so keep feature/`testing` branches off `main` if you don't
  want them reset.

- Every release must bump `__version__` in `src/kiro_crew/__init__.py`, or the
  version comparison won't detect the update.
